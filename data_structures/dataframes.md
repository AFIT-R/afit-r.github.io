A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R and, generally, is the data structure most often used for data analyses. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors. Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows. As a result, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column (i.e. numeric, character, factor). In essence, the easiest way to think of a data frame is as an Excel worksheet that contains columns of different types of data but are all of equal length rows.  In this section you will learn how to perform basic operations with a data frame to include:
