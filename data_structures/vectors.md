The basic structure in R is the vector.  A vector is a sequence of data elements of the same basic type: [integer](http://uc-r.github.io/integer_double/), [double](http://uc-r.github.io/integer_double/), logical, or [character](http://uc-r.github.io/characters) (there are two additional vector types which I will not discuss - complex and raw). This tutorial provides you with the basics of managing vectors.
