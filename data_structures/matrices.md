A matrix is a collection of data elements arranged in a two-dimensional rectangular layout.  In R, the elements that make up a matrix must be of a consistant mode (i.e. all elements must be numeric, or character, etc.).  Therefore, a matrix can be thought of as an atomic vector with a dimension attribute.  Furthermore, all rows of a matrix must be of same length.  In this section we cover the basics of managing matrices to include:
