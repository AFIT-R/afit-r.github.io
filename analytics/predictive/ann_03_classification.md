Classification ANNs seek to classify an observation as belonging to some discrete class as a function of the inputs. The input features (independent variables) can be categorical or numeric types, however, we require a categorical feature as the dependent variable.

## Replication Requirements {#req}

The following packages are required for classification ANN analysis.


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(neuralnet)
library(GGally)
```

<br>

## Data Preparation {#prep}

Our classification ANN will use [Haberman's Survival](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/haberman/haberman.data) data set from UCI's Machine Learning Repository. Haberman's data set was provided by Tjen-Sien Lim [email](mailto:stat.wisc.edu), and contains cases from a 1958 and 1970 study conducted at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of 306 patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer. We will use this data set to predict a patient's 5-year survival as a function of their age at date of operation, year of the operation, and the number of positive axillary nodes detected.

We first download the data from UCI. When this data is imported, the `Survival` feature is imported as an integer, this needs to be a categorical logical value so we will modify this feature using the`mutate()` function in the `dplyr` package. A value of 1 in the `Survival` feature indicates that the patient survived for at least 5 years after the operation, and a value of 0 indites that the patient died within 5 years. 


```r
url <- 'http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases//haberman/haberman.data'

Hab_Data <- read_csv(file = url,
                     col_names = c('Age', 'Operation_Year', 
                                   'Number_Pos_Nodes','Survival')) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(Survival = ifelse(Survival == 2, 0, 1),
         Survival = factor(Survival))
```

A brief examination of the data set...


```r
ggpairs(Hab_Data, title = "Scatterplot Matrix of the Features of the Haberman's Survival Data Set")
```

<img src="ANN_classification_files/figure-html/class01-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

shows that many more patients survived at least 5 years after the operation. Of the patients that survived (bottom-subplots of the `Survival` row in the Scatterplot Matrix), we see many of the patients have few numbers of positive axillary nodes detected. Examination of the `Age` feature shows a few of the most elderly patients died within 5 years, and of the youngest patients we see increased 5-year survivability. We forego any more detailed visual inspection in favor of learning the relationships between the features using our classification ANN. 

As in the regression ANN, we must scale our features to fall on the closed $[0,1]$ interval. For classification ANNs using the `neuralnet` package we will not use a training and test set for model evaluation, instead we will use the **Akaike Information Criterion** ([AIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion)) and **Bayesian Information Criterion** ([BIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_information_criterion)) for final model selection. These metrics balance the error as a function of the total number of model parameters, in the ANN case the model parameters correspond to the total number of hidden nodes.


```r
scale01 <- function(x){
  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))
}

Hab_Data <- Hab_Data %>%
  mutate(Age = scale01(Age), 
         Operation_Year = scale01(Operation_Year), 
         Number_Pos_Nodes = scale01(Number_Pos_Nodes), 
         Survival = as.numeric(Survival)-1)
```

Classification ANNs in the `neuralnet` package require that the response feature, in this case `Survival`, be inputted as a Boolean feature. We modify the feature then run the initial classification ANN.


```r
Hab_Data <- Hab_Data %>%
  mutate(Survival = as.integer(Survival) - 1, 
         Survival = ifelse(Survival == 1, TRUE, FALSE))
```

## 1st Classification ANN {#one-layer}

We construct a 1-hidden layer ANN with 1 neuron. The `neuralnet` package defaults to random initial weight values, for reproducibility we set a seed and construct the network. We have added three additional arguments for the classification ANN using the `neuralnet` package, `linear.output`, `err.fct`, and `likelihood`. Setting the `linear.output` to `FALSE` and the `err.fct` to "ce" indicates that we are performing a classification, and forces the model to output what we may interpret as a probability of each observation belonging to `Survival` class 1. For classification ANN the cross-entropy error metric is more appropriate than the SSE used in regression ANNs. The `likelihood` argument set to TRUE indicates to `neuralnet` that we would like to see the AIC and BIC metrics. 


```r
set.seed(123)
Hab_NN1 <- neuralnet(Survival ~ Age + Operation_Year + Number_Pos_Nodes, 
                     data = Hab_Data, 
                     linear.output = FALSE, 
                     err.fct = 'ce', 
                     likelihood = TRUE)
```

The `Hab_NN1` is a list containing all parameters of the classification ANN as well as the results of the neural network on the test data set. To view a diagram of the `Hab_NN1` use the `plot()` function.


```r
plot(Hab_NN1, rep = 'best')
```

<img src="ANN_classification_files/figure-html/class02-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The error displayed in this plot is the cross-entropy error, which is a measure of the differences between the predicted and observed output for each of the observations in the `Hab_Data` data set. To view the `Hab_NN1` AIC, BIC, and error metrics run the following.


```r
Hab_NN1_Train_Error <- Hab_NN1$result.matrix[1,1]
paste("CE Error: ", round(Hab_NN1_Train_Error, 3)) 
## [1] "CE Error:  0.009"
Hab_NN1_AIC <- Hab_NN1$result.matrix[4,1]
paste("AIC: ", round(Hab_NN1_AIC,3))
## [1] "AIC:  12.017"
Hab_NN2_BIC <- Hab_NN1$result.matrix[5,1]
paste("BIC: ", round(Hab_NN2_BIC, 3))
## [1] "BIC:  34.359"
```

## Classification Hyperparameters {#hyper}

Classification ANNs within the `neuralnet` package require the use of the ce error. This forces us into using the default `act.fun` hyperparameter value. As a result we will only change the structure of the classification ANNs using the `hidden` function setting. 


```r
set.seed(123)
# 2-Hidden Layers, Layer-1 2-neurons, Layer-2, 1-neuron
Hab_NN2 <- neuralnet(Survival ~ Age + Operation_Year + Number_Pos_Nodes, 
                     data = Hab_Data, 
                     linear.output = FALSE, 
                     err.fct = 'ce', 
                     likelihood = 
                       TRUE, hidden = c(2,1))

# 2-Hidden Layers, Layer-1 2-neurons, Layer-2, 2-neurons
set.seed(123)
Hab_NN3 <- Hab_NN2 <- neuralnet(Survival ~ Age + Operation_Year + Number_Pos_Nodes, 
                                data = Hab_Data, 
                                linear.output = FALSE, 
                                err.fct = 'ce', 
                                likelihood = TRUE, 
                                hidden = c(2,2))

# 2-Hidden Layers, Layer-1 1-neuron, Layer-2, 2-neuron
set.seed(123)
Hab_NN4 <- Hab_NN2 <- neuralnet(Survival ~ Age + Operation_Year + Number_Pos_Nodes, 
                                data = Hab_Data, 
                                linear.output = FALSE, 
                                err.fct = 'ce', 
                                likelihood = TRUE, 
                                hidden = c(1,2))

# Bar plot of results
Class_NN_ICs <- tibble('Network' = rep(c("NN1", "NN2", "NN3", "NN4"), each = 3), 
                       'Metric' = rep(c('AIC', 'BIC', 'ce Error * 100'), length.out = 12),
                       'Value' = c(Hab_NN1$result.matrix[4,1], Hab_NN1$result.matrix[5,1], 
                                   100*Hab_NN1$result.matrix[1,1], Hab_NN2$result.matrix[4,1], 
                                   Hab_NN2$result.matrix[5,1], 100*Hab_NN2$result.matrix[1,1],
                                   Hab_NN3$result.matrix[4,1], Hab_NN3$result.matrix[5,1], 
                                   100*Hab_NN3$result.matrix[1,1], Hab_NN4$result.matrix[4,1], 
                                   Hab_NN4$result.matrix[5,1], 100*Hab_NN4$result.matrix[1,1]))

Class_NN_ICs %>%
  ggplot(aes(Network, Value, fill = Metric)) +
  geom_col(position = 'dodge')  +
  ggtitle("AIC, BIC, and Cross-Entropy Error of the Classification ANNs", "Note: ce Error displayed is 100 times its true value")
```

<img src="ANN_classification_files/figure-html/class03-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The plot indicates that as we add hidden layers and nodes within those layers, our AIC and cross-entropy error grows. The BIC appears to remain relatively constant across the designs. Here we have a case where Occam's razor clearly applies, the 'best' classification ANN is the simplest.

## Wrapping Up {#summary}

We have briefly covered classification ANNs in this tutorial. In future tutorials we will cover more advanced applications of ANNs. Also, keep in mind that the `neuralnet` package used in this tutorial is only one of many tools available for ANN implementation in R. Others include:

* `nnet`  
* `autoencoder`  
* `caret`  
* `RSNNS`  
* `h2o`

Before you move on, test your new knowledge on the exercises that follow.

1. Build your own classification ANN using the `Hab_Data` data set. 
2. The `iris` data set contains 4 numeric features describing 3 plant species. Think about how we would need to modify the `iris` data set to prepare it for a classification ANN. Hint, the data set for classification will have 7 total features.
3. R package `nnet` has the capacity to build classification ANNs. Install and take a look at the documentation of  `nnet` to see how it compares with `neuralnet`.
