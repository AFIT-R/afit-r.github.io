Predictive methodologies use knowledge, usually extracted from historical data, to predict future, or otherwise unknown, events. Analytic techniques that fall into this category include a wide range of approaches to include parametric methods such as time series forecasting, linear regression, multilevel modeling, simulation methods such as discrete event simulation and agent-based modeling; classification methods such as logistic regression and decision trees; and artificial intelligence methods such as artificial neural networks and bayesian networks. The following tutorials walk you through common forms of predictive analytics.
