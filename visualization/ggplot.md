The [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) package, created by Hadley Wickham, offers a powerful graphics language for creating elegant and complex plots. Its popularity in the R community has exploded in recent years. Originally based on Leland Wilkinson's [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468184428&sr=8-1&keywords=grammar+of+graphics), ggplot2 allows you to create customized graphs tailored to your problem by building the plots with layers. The following tutorials walks you through common forms of visualization and how you can use ggplot to create advanced, publication worthy graphics.
