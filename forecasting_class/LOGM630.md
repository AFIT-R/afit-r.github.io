Companies, governments and other organizations now collect and analyze huge amounts of data about suppliers, clients, employees, citizens, transactions, and much more. There are a number of ways organizations can use this data. Business analytics uses this data to make better decisions and forecasting is a powerful and commonly used branch of business analytics. Forecasting especially can provide a potent toolkit for analyzing time series data.

This course focuses on forecasting time series, where past and present values are used to forecast future values of a series of interest. This course covers issues relating to different steps of the forecasting process, from goal definition, through data visualization, modeling, and performance evaluation to model deployment.

* Additional Resources: 
    - [Book website](http://www.forecastingbook.com/)
    - [Forecasting tutorials](https://afit-r.github.io/predictive#time-series) (will continue to expand)
    - [Business Analytics Using Forecasting](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/business-analytics-forecasting) (online course you will work through during the first 6 weeks)


## Course Objectives

The primary objective of this course is to help the student understand the basic analytic techniques and processes for forecasting and how to use them to make better decisions. More specifically, at the completion of the course, each student should be able to:

- Define a forecasting task and workflow
- Evaluate a forecasting performance
- Apply and be familiar with popular forecasting methods
- Explore, identify and model different types of patterns in time series
- Be able to implement a forecasting process in practice


## Resources

Students can use one of the following books.  Both books cover the same topics, one focuses on implementing the techniques in the R programming language while the other focuses on implemention with XLMiner, an Excel add-on.

- *Practical Time Series Forecasting with R: A Hands-On Guide* (2nd Ed.) by Shmueli & Lichtendahl, ISBN-10: 0997847913
- *Practical Time Series Forecasting: A Hands-On Guide* (3rd Ed.) by G. Shmueli, ISBN-10: 0991576659

In addition to the book, students will participate in a 6 week free online course ([Business Analytics Using Forecasting](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/business-analytics-forecasting)) led by the author of the textbook.  This course closely aligns with the book and covers the first 7 chapters.  Students will need to register for this couse and be prepared to start the first session on Oct 2nd.  Students can find a link to register for this course at [http://www.forecastingbook.com/mooc](http://www.forecastingbook.com/mooc).

Students can also leverage the textbook’s website ([http://www.forecastingbook.com/home](http://www.forecastingbook.com/home)) for additional resources such as data, R code, XLMiner tutorial videos, and additional video discussions for each chapter of the book.


## Class Structure 

This course blends textbook reading with online lectures and demonstrations that emphasize discussion and illustration of methods, as well as hands-on, practical applications that provide both a sound base of learning and an opportunity to test and develop skill.  Students will blend learning from the textbook with the 6 week online course.  A **flipped** classroom will be emphasized where students spend time outside the classroom learning the material via the textbook and online course and the majority of in-class activities will be reserved to review, clarify, and do hands-on projects.  Thus, students should bring a laptop to class and be prepared to implement the tools and skills they are learning.  Students should expect to dedicate approximately 2 hours of time outside of the classroom performing coursework for every 1 hour in the classroom.

## Performance Evaluation

This is a project-based course.  Depending on enrollment, students will work in groups of 4-5 students.  Throughout the course each group will spend classroom time completing *__all three__* of the case studies listed in the back of the textbook. Your final course grade will be determined according to the following requirements and their respective weights. 

- 15% [Case studies eval #1](#eval)
- 15% [Case studies eval #2](#eval)
- 20% [Group presentation](#pres)
- 40% [Final case study](#final)
- 10% [Engagement](#engage)

- There will be no midterm or final exam

Final grades will be distributed according to the following cutoffs:
		
- A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 94 – 100% 
- A- &nbsp;&nbsp;      90 – 93%
- B+ &nbsp;&nbsp;      87 – 89%	
- B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 83 – 86%
- B- &nbsp;&nbsp;      80 – 82%
- C+ &nbsp;&nbsp;      77 – 79%
- C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       73 – 76%
- C- &nbsp;&nbsp;      70 – 72%
- D & F &nbsp;  Hopefully None!

### Case Study Evaluations {#eval}

Throughout the term you will progressively complete all three case studies.  You will submit your case study progress two times during the term for progress evaluations.  These progress checks will provide you direction for final completion.  Further guidance regarding expectations for each case study evaluation will be provided in class.

### Group Presentation {#pres}

During week 10, each group will select one of their case studies to present.  Although your case study analysis may only be 90% complete at this time, this provides an opportunity to present your work to date and receive feedback from the class and instructor on where improvements and clarification could be made.  Further guidance regarding expectations for the group presentation will be provided in class.

### Final Case Study {#final}

Throughout the term you will progressively complete all three case studies and the instructor will randomly draw one of the group’s three submissions to grade for their final project.  Further guidance regarding expectations for the final case study submissions will be provided in class.

### Engagement {#engage}

At the end of the term I will have all students perform a peer assessment of their small group members. This assessment will rate each member in several areas regarding:

- Engaging in quality discussions with the group to improve forecasting knowledge
- Coming to each class prepared to further the case study analyses
- Providing adequate contribution to group work
- Working well as a team member in the small group activities
- etc.

I will use this feedback to help in determining your level of engagement.

## Software

This is an applied course and you will be using software during class time. Therefore, plan on bringing a computer to each class meeting. Furthermore, you will need some software to perform the forecasting procedures.

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/):  Students familiar with the R programming language can leverage this software. You can find details on how to download these [here](basics#installation). This is the software the instructor uses and is familiar with.
* [XLMiner](https://www.solver.com/xlminer-platform): Students that are not comfortable with R programming can use the free student version of XLMiner.  Note that the instructor is not familiar with this software so you will be on your own for troubleshooting.  You can find details on how to download this sofware [here](xlminer_install).
* [Slack](https://slack.com/) will replace e-mail and Blackboard for our course. You will receive an invitation to the [AFIT Forecasting slack team](https://afit-forecasting.slack.com). You may wish to install one of the [apps](https://slack.com/downloads/osx).

Individuals who violate this policy are subject to adverse administrative action including disenrollment from school and disciplinary action. Individuals subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be prosecuted under it. Violations by government civilian employees may result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws. (References: Student Handbook, ENOI 36 – 107, *Academic Integrity*)
3. __Academic Grievance:__ AFIT and the Graduate School of Engineering and Management affirm the right of each student to resolve grievances with the Institution. Students are guaranteed the right of fair hearing and appeal in all matters of judgment of academic performance. Procedures are detailed in ENOI 36 – 138, *Student Academic Performance Appeals*.
4. __Testing Policy:__ This is a project-based course. Consequently there will be no midterm or final exam.
