Throughout the term you will progressively complete all three case studies. You will submit your case study progress two times during the term for progress evaluations. Each of these deliverables will contribute towards your final project report and are worth 20 points each.  The purpose of these deliverables are to provide you with ample time to methodically develop your final project and it allows me to provide feedback to help shape your final project.

The following describes each deliverable and provides the expectations based on the [final project standards](LOGM630_final_project):
