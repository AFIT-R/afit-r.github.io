As well as numerical vectors, R allows manipulation of logical quantities. The elements of a
logical vector can have the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for “not available”, see below). The
first two are often abbreviated as T and F, respectively. Note however that T and F are just
variables which are set to TRUE and FALSE by default, but are not reserved words and hence can
be overwritten by the user. Hence, you should always use TRUE and FALSE.
Logical vectors are generated by conditions. For example
> temp <- x > 13
sets temp as a vector of the same length as x with values FALSE corresponding to elements of x
where the condition is not met and TRUE where it is.
The logical operators are <, <=, >, >=, == for exact equality and != for inequality. In addition
if c1 and c2 are logical expressions, then c1 & c2 is their intersection (“and”), c1 | c2 is their
union (“or”), and !c1 is the negation of c1.
Logical vectors may be used in ordinary arithmetic, in which case they are coerced into
numeric vectors, FALSE becoming 0 and TRUE becoming 1. However there are situations where
logical vectors and their coerced numeric counterparts are not equivalent, for example see the
next subsection.
