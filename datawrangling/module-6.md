Last week we discussed general guidelines for first interacting with a new data set. This week we want to build on those activities by performing early exploratory data analysis to answer questions about your data via visualizing and transforming your data. We have two objectives for this week:

1. Visualization should be used in explicit ways to answer questions regarding your data. You will learn how to use ggplot to advance your visualization skills to systematically analyze your data.
2. Early in the data wrangling process you will likely need to sort, filter, or summarize your data set or even create new variables from the existing data. You will learn how to work with the `dplyr` package to perform many common data transformation and manipulation tasks.


Combining the activities of data transformation and visualization in a methodical way is what defines *exploratory data analysis* (EDA). Only by systematically applying these techniques will you be able to answer and refine questions about your data.  Module 5 focuses on the transformation component of EDA.

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your project deliverable #3.

__Transform your data:__ Although many fundamental data manipulation functions exist in R, they have been a bit convoluted to date and have lacked consistent coding and the ability to easily flow together. `dplyr` is one such package which was built for the sole purpose of simplifying the process of manipulating, sorting, summarizing, and joining data frames.  Read and work through the [Transforming Your Data with dplyr tutorial](dplyr)
