Welcome to Operational Data Science with R! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to data science with the R programming language. You will learn the fundamental skills required to acquire, munge, transform, manipulate, visualize, and model data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility.


## Course Overview
Data Science is the study of the generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. Being a data scientist requires an integrated skill set spanning operations research, statistics, and computer science along with a good understanding of crafting a problem formulation for effective solutions. This course will introduce students to this rapidly growing field and equip them with some of its basic principles and tools as well as its general mindset.  Students will learn concepts, techniques and tools they need to deal with various facets of data science practice, including data collection and integration, exploratory data analysis, descriptive and predictive modeling, data product creation, evaluation, and effective communication. The focus in the treatment of these topics will be on breadth, rather than depth, and emphasis will be placed on integration and synthesis of concepts and their application to solving problems. To make the learning contextual, real datasets from a variety of Air Force domains will be used.

## Course Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

- Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment
- Import and manage structured and unstructured data
- Manipulate, transform, and summarize your data
- Join disparate data sources
- Methodically explore and visualize your data
- Perform iterative functions
- Write your own functions
- Understand the implementation of a breadth of modeling techniques
- Execute an analytic technique thoroughly

...all with R!

## Class Structure 

This class emphasizes a *"flipped"* class style where you learn the material outside of class and then spend the majority of in-class time reviewing and executing code.

### First Half of Quarter

Each week I plan to have you read through selected tutorials on specific analytic activities in R. I will assign problems/activities that you will need to perform prior to each session. Then in each class I'll spend about 15-30 minutes reviewing the analytic activity and answer any burning questions. Then you will break up into defined small groups and review each others code and approaches to solving the assigned problems. And finally, for the last hour of class you and your small group will work together to complete another task. 

The purpose for this course structure is multi-dimensional:

1. It will teach you to read and learn R programming tutorials and techniques on your own
2. The out-of-class assignments will force you to come to each class prepared and these assignments will also prepare you for your final project
3. The in-class peer review will help you get feedback on your code and also teach you to review other people's code
4. The in-class small group work will teach you to work on a coding task collaboratively and within a constrained time limit

### Second Half of Quarter

The second half of the quarter will be student driven.  Students will select an analytic technique that is relevant to their thesis.  Students will learn how to execute this technique along with interpreting and validating the results.  Students will generate a toy-problem tutorial and present/teach to the class.  Furthermore, students will apply this technique to their thesis data for their final project.  By the end of this class you should have initial results for one of your thesis objectives!


## Material

All required classroom material will be provided in class or online. Any recommended yet optional material will also be provided in the classroom notes.

## Software

We will use this software during the course. Plan on bringing a computer to each class meeting.

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) will be used to perform all programming activities, assignments, and the final project.  You can find details on how to download these [here](http://uc-r.github.io/section2_basics#installation).
* [Slack](https://slack.com/) will replace e-mail and Blackboard for our course. You will receive an invitation to the [UC Data Wrangling slack team](https://uc-data-wrangling.slack.com/). You may wish to install one of the [apps](https://slack.com/downloads/osx). Here is an [introduction to Slack](https://vimeo.com/133692325) from one of Kris Shaffer’s courses (although this is a completely different course and slack team it provides a nice introduction that you might find useful).



## Fine Print

<u>Academic Integrity</u>: As with all Lindner College of Business efforts, this course will uphold the highest ethical standards, which are critical to building character. LCB instructors are required to report ANY incident of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism) to the college review process, which could result in severe consequences, including potential dismissal from the college. For further information on Academic Misconduct or related university policies and procedures, please see the [UC Code of Conduct](http://www.uc.edu/conduct/Code_of_Conduct.html)

All academic programs at the Lindner College of Business apply a “Two Strikes Policy” regarding Academic Integrity. Any student who has been found responsible for two cases of academic misconduct may be dismissed from the College. The “Two Strikes Policy” supplements the UC Student Code of Conduct.

All cases of academic misconduct (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, falsification) will be formally reported by faculty. Students will be afforded due process for allegations, as outlined in the policy. If a student is found guilty of academic misconduct in two instances, the student may be dismissed from the Lindner College of Business.  The “Two Strikes Policy” is now in effect.

<u>Disability</u>: Students with disabilities who need academic accommodations or other specialized services while attending the University of Cincinnati will receive reasonable accommodations to meet their individual needs as well as advocacy assistance on disability-related issues. Students requiring special accommodation must register with the [Disability Services Office](http://www.uc.edu/aess/disability.html).

<u>Attendance</u>: Your attendance is expected at every meeting. If you must be absent, I request that you notify me in advance of the class meeting.

<u>Grade appeals</u>: If you think the grade of your work (homework, peer reviews, participation) is miscalculated, you have the right to appeal. The appeal must be done (through email) within 7 calendar days since the grade is released/posted. After that, your grade is final and will not be changed.
