Welcome to the first session! This first module will focus on making sure everyone is on the same page regarding the syllabus, deliverables, small group assignment and other administrative details.  We will also make sure you are up and running with R, RStudio, and Slack.

## Tutorials & Resources

Please read & work through the following prior to our first class. 

### Syllabus

If you have not already done so, be sure to read through the syllabus for your section [[OPER-682]](oper682) [[LOGM-682]](logm682) so that you understand the structure of my classes, the tentative schedule, grading policies, and other pertinent details.

### Communication

[Slack](https://slack.com/) will replace e-mail and Blackboard for our course. You will receive an invitation to the [AFIT DSL slack team](https://afit-dsl.slack.com/). You may wish to install one of the [apps](https://slack.com/downloads/osx). If you have any questions or concerns your first step should be to go to our [class slack channel](https://afit-dsl.slack.com/) and post your issue.  You and your classmates should be monitoring slack to help each other out. In addition, I will also be watching slack and will chime in when necessary but my hope is that this will be a social process where everyone contributes to knowledge advancement.

- Watch and read the introductory material to get started with Slack [here](https://slack.com/is).
- You can also read this [introduction to Slack](https://vimeo.com/133692325) from one of Kris Shafferâ€™s courses (although this is a completely different course and slack team it provides a nice introduction that you might find useful).  

### Intro to Data Science

- Read [The Analytic Cycle](analytic_cycle)
- [Watch R's Role in Data Science](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/rs-role-in-data-science/)

### Intro to R

- Read the [Introduction to R tutorial](intro).
- Work through the [R Basics tutorial](basics) to install R and RStudio and (re-)familiarize yourself with the basic functionality of the programming language.
- Watch RStudio's webinar on [writing code](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-part-1/).

## Class Prep

Complete the following before class:

1. Sign into the Slack channel and post a witty comment.
2. Create a .R script and perform the exercises throughout the [R Basics tutorial](basics).  By the end of class submit this .R script to me via Slack.  Be sure to name this file with year, class number, lastname, first and middle initial, then "session1". For example my file name would be: 

   - OPER 682: 2017_OPER682_boehmkebc_session1.R.
   - LOGM 682: 2017_LOGM682_boehmkebc_session1.R.
   - You will follow this naming convention throughout the course.

See you in class!
