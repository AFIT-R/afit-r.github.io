The last couple of weeks we have been working with data frames. Data frames are the most common way of storing data in R and, generally, is the data structure most often used for data analyses; it is R’s version of an Excel spreadsheet. This module is going to put more focus on working with the different structures that hold data in R.

Specifically, you are going to learn: 

1. The most common data structures in R.
2. How to manage these data structures.
3. How to make your data "tidy".

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to class. 

1. __Managing Data Structures:__ R’s base data structures can be organized by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they’re homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types). This gives rise to five data types most often used in data analysis, and the five data types that nearly all R objects and outputs are built upon.  To understand and appropriately manage these data structures, read and work through:
   - [Data structure basics](structure_basics)
   - [Managing vectors](vectors)
   - [Managing matrices](matrices)
   - [Managing lists](lists)
   - [Manging data frames](dataframes)
   - [Managing tibbles](tibbles)

2. __How to make your data "tidy":__ Most functions require your data to be well organized and in a specific format.  This may require you to manipulate the structure of your data (i.e. long vs. wide data) so that it is properly organized for the next activity.  Read and work through [Chapter 12: Tidy Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) to learn how to organize your data the "tidy" way.
