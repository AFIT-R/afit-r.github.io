Module 7...

<hr>

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to class. The skills and functions introduced in these tutorials will be necessary to complete your project deliverable #3.

1. __Transform your data:__ Although many fundamental data manipulation functions exist in R, they have been a bit convoluted to date and have lacked consistent coding and the ability to easily flow together. `dplyr` is one such package which was built for the sole purpose of simplifying the process of manipulating, sorting, summarizing, and joining data frames.  Read and work through [Chapter 5: Data Transformation](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) in R for Data Science.

2. __Exploratory data analysis:__ Combining visualization and data transformation allows you to efficiently explore your data. Read and work through [Chapter 7: Exploratory Data Analysis](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html) in R for Data Science.

## Class Prep

1. Work through the exercises in Chapters 5 & 7 of R for Data Science.
2. Building onto the last module, expand the previous list of questions or identify at least 10 new questions you want to ask of your thesis data.  What exploratory data analysis sequences do you need to implement to answer these questions?  Be ready to use `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to answer these questions in class.
