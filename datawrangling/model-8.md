It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single data set. Typically you have many sets of data and you need to join them to perform your analysis and answer the questions that you’re interested in.

## Tutorials & Resources

Please work through the following tutorials prior to class. 

1. __Managing Data Structures:__ R’s base data structures can be organized by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they’re homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types). This gives rise to five data types most often used in data analysis, and the five data types that nearly all R objects and outputs are built upon.  You already have a strong understanding of data frames; however, it's important to understand and appropriately manage the other data structures as you will likely come across them down the road.  Read and work through:
   - [Data structure basics](structure_basics)
   - [Managing vectors](vectors)
   - [Managing matrices](matrices)
   - [Managing lists](lists)
   
Putting our focus back on data frames, a relatively new "modified" version of the data frame has been established and is referred to as a *tibble*.  Tibbles are data frames, but they tweak some older behaviors to make life a little easier. Go ahead and read through the [Managing Tibbles](tutorial).

2\. __How to make your data "tidy":__ The majority of our analyses will be for the purpose of studying a specific data frame/tibble.  However, most functions require your data frame to be well organized and in a specific format.  This may require you to manipulate the structure of your data (i.e. long vs. wide data) so that it is properly organized for the next activity.  Read and work through [Chapter 12: Tidy Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) in R for Data Science to learn how to organize your data the "tidy" way.
