During the first half of the quarter, each student will need to submit 4 project deliverables.  Each of these deliverables will contribute towards your final project report and are worth 10 points each.  The purpose of these deliverables are to provide you with ample time to methodically develop your final project and it allows me to provide feedback to help shape your final project.

The following outlines the deliverables expectations:
