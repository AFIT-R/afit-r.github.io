## Tutorials & Resources

Please read & work through the following prior to our first class. 


### Reproducibility & Analytic Workflow

- Read [Reproducible Research in Computational Science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383002/?utm_content=buffer518fc&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).
- Read [A Statistical Definition for Reproducibility and Replicability](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/07/29/066803.full.pdf) or the blog post [The Real Reason Reproducible Research is Important](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/) that provides a shorter summary.

### Reproducibility & Analytic Workflow in R

- Read the tutorials on [R projects](r-projects), [R markdown](r_markdown), and [notebooks](r_notebook).
- Watch [Getting Started with R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/).


## Deliverables

Complete the following before class:

1. Follow along in the [Getting Started with R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/) webinar and bring a copy of the HTML and PDF report that this webinar explains how to produce (have the final results report on a stock of your choice).
2. Bring electronic copies of the following to class:
   - Thesis problem statement.
   - Thesis research objectives.
   - Identify the one objective you'd like to try answer through this class and the analytic technique you plan to apply to do so.
   - An image relevant to the problem statement or analytic technique.

See you in class!
