## Tutorials & Resources

Please read & work through the following prior to our first class. 


### Reproducibility & Analytic Workflow

- Watch ...

### Reproducibility & Analytic Workflow in R

- Read the tutorials on [R projects](r-projects), [R markdown](r_markdown), and [notebooks](r_notebook).
- Watch [Getting Started with R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/)


## Deliverables

Complete the following before class:

1. Sign into the Slack channel and post a witty comment.
2. Create a .R script titled "day-1.R" and in this script perform the following exercises:
   - compute $$100(1 + \frac{0.05}{12})^{24}$$
   - what is the remainder when 3333 is divided by 222?
   - investigate the behavior of $$(1 + \frac{1}{n})^n$$ for large, integer values in *n*.
   - the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) gives the optimal order quantity as $$Q = \sqrt{\frac{2DK}{h}}$$ where *D* is the annual demand, *K* is the fixed cost per order, and *h* is the annual holding cost per item. Create and set the variables $$D = 1000$$, $$K = 5$$, and $$h = 0.25$$ and compute the associated value of Q.
   - for an initial principal amount *P* and a nominal annual interest rate *r* that is compounded *n* times per year over a span of *t* years, the final value of a certificate of deposit is $$F = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$. Create and set the variables $$P = 100$$, $$r = 0.08$$, $$n = 12$$, and $$t = 3$$ and compute the associated value of *F*.

See you in class!
