The workflow one uses for data analysis will determine the efficiency and reproducibility of that analysis. For example...

- one day you will need to stop in the middle of your analysis, go do something else and then the next day return to your analysis and pick up where you left off. 
- one day you will be working on multiple analyses simultaneously and you will want to keep them organized in a separate fashion. 
- one day you will need to go back to an analysis you did two months ago and re-execute the analysis with new data.
- one day you will need to turn your thesis analysis into a written report and then convert the same analysis into a defense presentation.

To be an effective and efficient analyst you need to understand how to manage your analytic workflow so that it fosters an organized environment and allows you to easily reproduce your work.  Furthermore, our data analysis should rarely live independent from our written report but, rather, be integrated with it.  This session will teach you how to organize your R files with R Projects and how you can use R Markdown in notebook mode for analyst-to-analyst communication, and in report mode for analyst-to-decision-maker communication.

## Tutorials & Resources

Please read & work through the following prior to our first class. 


### Reproducibility

- Read [Reproducible Research in Computational Science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3383002/?utm_content=buffer518fc&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer).
- Read [A Statistical Definition for Reproducibility and Replicability](http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/07/29/066803.full.pdf) or the blog post [The Real Reason Reproducible Research is Important](https://simplystatistics.org/2014/06/06/the-real-reason-reproducible-research-is-important/) that provides a shorter summary.

### Reproducibility & Analytic Workflow in R

- Read the tutorials on [R projects](r-projects), [R markdown](r_markdown), and [notebooks](r_notebook).
- Watch [Getting Started with R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/).

## Deliverables

Complete the following before class:

1. Follow along in the [Getting Started with R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/getting-started-with-r-markdown/) webinar and bring a copy of the HTML and PDF report that this webinar explains how to produce (have the final results report on a stock of your choice).
2. Bring electronic copies of the following to class:
   - Thesis problem statement.
   - Thesis research objectives.
   - Identify the one objective you'd like to try answer through this class and the analytic technique you plan to apply to do so.
   - An image relevant to the problem statement or analytic technique.

See you in class!
