Welcome to Applied Business Analytics with R! This course provides an applied introduction to the field of business analytics, which has been defined as the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, exploratory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions.  In this course you will experience an intensive, hands-on introduction to applied business analytics with the R programming language. You will learn and apply the fundamental skills required to acquire, munge, transform, manipulate, visualize, and analyze data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility.

## Course Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

- Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment
- Import and manage structured and unstructured data
- Manipulate, transform, and summarize your data
- Join disparate data sources
- Methodically explore and visualize your data
- Perform iterative functions
- Write your own functions
- Understand the implementation of a breadth of modeling techniques
- Execute an analytic technique thoroughly

...all with R!

## Class Structure 

This class emphasizes a *"flipped"* class style where you learn the material outside of class and then spend the majority of in-class time reviewing and executing code.

### First Half of Quarter

Each week I plan to have you read through selected tutorials on specific analytic activities in R. I will assign problems/activities that you will need to perform prior to each session. Then in each class I'll spend about 15-30 minutes reviewing the analytic activity and answer any burning questions. Then you will break up into defined small groups and review each others code and approaches to solving the assigned problems. And finally, for the last 30-45 min of class you and your small group will work together to complete another task. 

The purpose for this course structure is multi-dimensional:

1. It will teach you to read and learn R programming tutorials and techniques on your own
2. The out-of-class assignments will force you to come to each class prepared and these assignments will also prepare you for your final project
3. The in-class peer review will help you get feedback on your code and also teach you to review other people's code
4. The in-class small group work will teach you to work on a coding task collaboratively and within a constrained time limit

### Second Half of Quarter

The second half of the quarter will be student driven.  Students will select an analytic technique that is relevant to their thesis.  Students will learn how to execute this technique along with interpreting and validating the results.  Students will generate a toy-problem tutorial and present/teach to the class.  Furthermore, students will apply this technique to their thesis data for their final project.  By the end of this class you should have initial results for one of your thesis objectives!


## Material

All required classroom material will be provided in class or online. Any recommended yet optional material will also be provided in the classroom notes.

## Software

We will use this software during the course. Plan on bringing a computer to each class meeting.

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) will be used to perform all programming activities, assignments, and the final project.  You can find details on how to download these [here](basics#installation).
* [Slack](https://slack.com/) will replace e-mail and Blackboard for our course. You will receive an invitation to the [AFIT DSL slack team](https://afit-dsl.slack.com/). You may wish to install one of the [apps](https://slack.com/downloads/osx). 



## Policies:

1. __Attendance:__ Attendance at all class sessions and exams is mandatory for military and civilians assigned to AFIT as full-time students except for extenuating circumstances. Scheduled classes and exams are defined by the instructor and they are documented in the course schedule. Part-time students are expected to attend scheduled classes, and absences should be explained to the instructor. The student should provide advance notice, if possible. (References: Student Handbook, Graduate School Catalog)
2. __Academic Integrity:__ All students must adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity. Students are prohibited from engaging in plagiarism, cheating, misrepresentation, or any other act constituting a lack of academic integrity. Failure on the part of any individual to practice academic integrity is not condoned and will not be tolerated. Individuals who violate this policy are subject to adverse administrative action including disenrollment from school and disciplinary action. Individuals subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be prosecuted under it. Violations by government civilian employees may result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws. (References: Student Handbook, ENOI 36 – 107, *Academic Integrity*)
3. __Academic Grievance:__ AFIT and the Graduate School of Engineering and Management affirm the right of each student to resolve grievances with the Institution. Students are guaranteed the right of fair hearing and appeal in all matters of judgment of academic performance. Procedures are detailed in ENOI 36 – 138, *Student Academic Performance Appeals*.
4. __Testing Policy:__ This is a project-based course. Consequently there will be no midterm or final exam.
5. __Late Assignments and Make-Ups:__ Late submissions will not be accepted.
6. __Tentative Plan:__ The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
