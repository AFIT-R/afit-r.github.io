Last week we discussed general guidelines for first interacting with a new data set. This week we want to build on those activities by performing early exploratory data analysis to answer questions about your data via visualizing and transforming your data. We have two objectives for this week:

1. Visualization should be used in explicit ways to answer questions regarding your data. You will learn how to use ggplot to advance your visualization skills to systematically analyze your data.
2. Early in the data wrangling process you will likely need to sort, filter, or summarize your data set or even create new variables from the existing data. You will learn how to work with the `dplyr` package to perform many common data transformation and manipulation tasks.


Combining the activities of data transformation and visualization in a methodical way is what defines *exploratory data analysis* (EDA). Only by systematically applying these techniques will you be able to answer and refine questions about your data.  Module 5 focuses on the transformation component of EDA.

## Tutorials & Resources

Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in data analysis. In this module you will learn to use the `ggplot2` library to visualize your data. As illustrated in the last module R does provide built-in plotting functions; however, the `ggplot2` library implements what is known as the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448). This makes it particularly effective for describing how visualizations should represent data, and has turned it into the preeminent plotting library in R.

The following tutorials will provide you the knowledge and skills required to create the meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned  data visualizations that I will be looking for in the remainder of your project deliverables.

1. __Introduction to `ggplot2`:__ Read [Chapter 3: Data Visualization](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) in R for Data Science to get an introduction to the `ggplot2` package.

2. __Advancing your visualizations:__
