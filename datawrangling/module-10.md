## Tutorials & Resources

**Factors:**  Historically, factors were much easier to work with than characters. As a result, many of the functions in base R automatically convert characters to factors. This means that factors often crop up in places where theyâ€™re not actually helpful and you need to understand how to manipulate and work with them. Read and work through *[Chapter 15: Factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html)*. 

**Dates:**  Real world data are often associated with dates and time; however, dealing with dates accurately can appear to be a complicated task due to the variety in formats and accounting for time-zone differences and leap years. Read and work through [*Chapter 16: Dates and times*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) to learn how to manage date-time data.
