Two common data types that we often deal with in analyses are factors and dates:

- Factors are used to represent categorical data, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values (i.e. Gender: Female vs. Male; Months: Jan, Feb, ..., Dec; Country: U.S., Germany, Japan).  
- Time series data have various date-time stamp information that can be very useful if we know how to properly work with them.

This module will teach you how to deal with these two data types.

## Tutorials & Resources

**Factors:**  Historically, factors were much easier to work with than characters. As a result, many of the functions in base R automatically convert characters to factors. This means that factors often crop up in places where theyâ€™re not actually helpful and you need to understand how to manipulate and work with them. Read and work through *[Chapter 15: Factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html)*. 

**Dates:**  Real world data are often associated with dates and time; however, dealing with dates accurately can appear to be a complicated task due to the variety in formats and accounting for time-zone differences and leap years. Read and work through [*Chapter 16: Dates and times*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) to learn how to manage date-time data.
