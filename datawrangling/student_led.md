Each student will be responsible for facilitating the learning of an analytic technique, either individually or as part of a two-person team, depending on course enrollment. The student(s) will:

1. Develop a tutorial that uses a toy data set and provides a step-by-step approach to executing the analytic technique in R.
2. Facilitate an active discussion on the analytic technique, a discussion of practical applications for the problem within the Department of Defense, and provide in-class exercises for the class to practice this technique in R. 


Based on our course enrollment, I will ask you to sign up for one of the 12 student-facilitated lessons. I will hand out a sign-up sheet to the senior-ranking uniformed military student taking the class and ask him/her to be the POC for the sign-ups between class sessions 1 and 2.

I will evaluate your facilitating based on the following five performance measures: (1) knowledge, (2) organization & design; (3) engagement; (4) communication; and (5) outcome achievement. A description of each, along with a rubric, follows.

1. __Knowledge__: You should become a subject matter expert in the topic you are facilitating. This will require substantial independent learning. However, I highly recommend you select an analytic technique that you plan to apply to your final project *and* aligns with your thesis problem.  This will allow you to refine your knowledge during this class, apply your knowledge to your thesis, and start extracting results.

2. __Tutorial__: Developing online tutorials are a fantastic way to learn topics in more depth, demonstrate your skills, and help build the analytic toolset of other analysts. Your tutorial will be written as a .Rmd file that can be knit to an HTML file and hosted on the *[AFIT Data Science Lab R Programming Guide](https://afit-r.github.io/)* website. Your tutorial should introduce the technique, provide the data and R packages to replicate the analysis, and then walk through the mathematical equations along with how to execute, validate, and interpret the analytic technique and results in R. 


Students facilitating a lesson need to meet with me at least a week prior to your lesson to propose how you plan to conduct it so that I can help you refine and/or improve it.
