Each student will facilitate the discussion for one of our class meetings, either individually or as part of a two-person team, depending on course enrollment. The student(s) will assign the specific readings for the cohort and, during the class, facilitate an active discussion on the problem formulation, an examination of some instances, a discussion of practical applications for the problem within the Department of Defense, and a discussion and comparison of solution methods (i.e., algorithms and heuristics, implementation ease and complexity). It may be necessary to present the application of an algorithm to a specific instance in order to illustrate it; otherwise, please be sure to deliberately involve students in discussions and/or exercises. Students facilitating a lesson need to meet with me at least a week prior to your lesson to propose how you plan to conduct it so that I can help you refine and/or improve it.
