Rapid growth of the World Wide Web has significantly changed the way we share, collect, and publish data. Vast amount of information is being stored online, both in structured and unstructured forms.  Regarding certain questions or research topics, this has resulted in a new problem - no longer is the concern of data scarcity and inaccessibility but, rather, one of overcoming the tangled masses of online data. 

Collecting data from the web is not an easy process as there are many technologies used to distribute web content (i.e. [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)). Therefore, dealing with more advanced web scraping requires familiarity in accessing data stored in these technologies via R. Through this section I will provide an introduction to some of the fundamental tools required to perform basic web scraping. This includes [importing spreadsheet data files stored online](), [scraping HTML text](), [scraping HTML table data](), and [leveraging APIs to scrape data]().

My purpose in the following sections is to discuss these topics at a level meant to get you started in web scraping; however, this area is vast and complex and this chapter will far from provide you expertise level insight.  To advance your knowledge I highly recommend getting copies of [*XML and Web Technologies for Data Sciences with R*](http://www.amazon.com/XML-Web-Technologies-Data-Sciences/dp/1461478995) and [*Automated Data Collection with R*](http://www.amazon.com/Automated-Data-Collection-Practical-Scraping/dp/111883481X/ref=pd_sim_14_1?ie=UTF8&dpID=51Tm7FHxWBL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL160_SR108%2C160_&refRID=1VJ1GQEY0VCPZW7VKANX).
