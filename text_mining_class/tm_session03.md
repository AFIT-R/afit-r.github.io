A fundamental requirement to perform text mining is to get your text in a tidy format and being able to perform word frequency analysis. Text is often in an unstructured format so performing even the most basic analysis requires some re-structuring. Read and work through the Tidying Text and Word Frequency tutorial to learn how to tidy unstructured text.
