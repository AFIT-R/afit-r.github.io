Each student will be required to develop slides, an R tutorial, and content to teach an 80 minute class on their assigned topic.  The student will read the material for that class, and in their own style, lead the class on the explanation of that topic.  This may include, but is not limited to: lecture to introduce the topic, an in class “follow along” tutorial, etc.  The topics are:

- N gram and word relationship
- Topic Analysis
- Text Classification
- Text Clustering
- Sentiment Analysis

During those lessons where you are not preparing a lesson on the topic, you will develop a 1-2 page paper summarizing the topic.  Use your space wisely, papers should be single spaced, Times New Roman font, 11 pt. and should be titled.   The paper should be formatted as a general titled paper, with your name and course in the upper right hand corner.  You are seeking to describe the topic and paraphrasing from the learning material your thoughts on the topic.  Additionally, you are to consider how the topic could be applied to your project (even if you don’t plan to apply the topic to your project).

Bottom line:  During each student led class, each student is responsible either to teach the class and the material associated with that, or responsible for a 1-2 page paper summarizing the topic of the day.

Material that can be used to assist include, but is not limited to:

- Text Mining with R, A Tidy Approach, J. Silge and D. Robinson, free webversion:  [tidytextmining.com/](http://tidytextmining.com/) 
- AFIT Data Science Lab R Programming gude. [afit-r.github.io/descriptive](https://afit-r.github.io/descriptive)

## Deliverables
The lesson planning / topic summarization is worth __15% of your total grade__ for this course.  
When instructing a minimum, student will deliver (__10 pts__):

-	Slides 
-	Tutorial walking student through the material using R

The material should be reviewed for accuracy by Andy McCarthy, Bldg 641, rm 230C, then submitted NLT COB the Thursday before teaching the class, to Dr. Boehmke  and LTC Smith via AFIT DSL Slack.  The material will be added to the course github site for use in the classroom.  The class must be timed to between 70-80 minutes (no planning for release earlier than this).

When summarizing, student will deliver a 1-2 page paper summarizing the topic to be submitted via AFIT DSL Slack NLT 30 minutes before class.  Grade assessed based on all five papers holistically (__5 pts__).
