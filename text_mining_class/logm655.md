Text mining is the organization, classification, labeling and extraction of information from text sources. In these days of more information readily available through the internet, analysts and decision makers find themselves overloaded with data.  Text mining is an application which can help analysts glean necessary information either for general understanding about a corpus of text documents, or for putting text into a form useful for the application of alternative analysis techniques.  

This course will introduce students to this rapidly growing field and equip them with some of its basic principles and tools as well as its general mindset.  Students will learn concepts, techniques and tools they need to deal with text mining practice in a Joint military context.

## Course Objectives

The primary objective of this course is to help the student understand the basic techniques and processes for text mining and how to use them to make better decisions. More specifically, at the completion of the course, each student should be able to:

- Understanding when, where, and how to perform text mining to appropriate problems and data sets.
- Code and understand code using relevant R packages in text mining.
- Lead and work within a group of researchers analyzing a specific text mining problem.

## Class Structure 

This course blends textbook reading with online lectures and demonstrations that emphasize discussion and illustration of methods, as well as hands-on, practical applications that provide both a sound base of learning and an opportunity to test and develop skill.  A **flipped** classroom will be emphasized where students spend time outside the classroom learning the material via the textbook and online material and the majority of in-class activities will be reserved to review, clarify, and do hands-on projects and coding.  Thus, students should bring a laptop to class and be prepared to implement the tools and skills they are learning.  Students should expect to dedicate approximately 2 hours of time outside of the classroom performing coursework for every 1 hour in the classroom.

## Performance Evaluation

This is a project-based course.  Depending on enrollment, students will work in groups of 4-5 students.  Throughout the course each group will spend classroom time completing *__all three__* of the case studies listed in the back of the textbook. Your final course grade will be determined according to the following requirements and their respective weights. 

- 15% Lesson Planning/Topic Summarization
- 25% Group Activities
- 60% Project

- There will be no midterm or final exam

Final grades will be distributed according to the following cutoffs:
		
- A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 94 – 100% 
- A- &nbsp;&nbsp;      90 – 93%
- B+ &nbsp;&nbsp;      87 – 89%	
- B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 83 – 86%
- B- &nbsp;&nbsp;      80 – 82%
- C+ &nbsp;&nbsp;      77 – 79%
- C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       73 – 76%
- C- &nbsp;&nbsp;      70 – 72%
- D & F &nbsp;  Hopefully None!

### Case Study Evaluations {#eval}

Throughout the term you will progressively complete all three case studies.  You will submit your case study progress two times during the term for progress evaluations.  These progress checks will provide you direction for final completion.  Further guidance regarding expectations for each case study evaluation will be provided in class.

### Group Presentation {#pres}

During week 10, each group will select one of their case studies to present.  Although your case study analysis may only be 90% complete at this time, this provides an opportunity to present your work to date and receive feedback from the class and instructor on where improvements and clarification could be made.  Further guidance regarding expectations for the group presentation will be provided in class.

### Final Case Study {#final}

Throughout the term you will progressively complete all three case studies and the instructor will randomly draw one of the group’s three submissions to grade for their final project.  Further guidance regarding expectations for the final case study submissions will be provided in class.

### Engagement {#engage}

At the end of the term I will have all students perform a peer assessment of their small group members. This assessment will rate each member in several areas regarding:

- Engaging in quality discussions with the group to improve forecasting knowledge
- Coming to each class prepared to further the case study analyses
- Providing adequate contribution to group work
- Working well as a team member in the small group activities
- etc.

I will use this feedback to help in determining your level of engagement.

## Software

This is an applied course and you will be using software during class time. Therefore, plan on bringing a computer to each class meeting. Furthermore, you will need some software to perform the forecasting procedures.

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/):  Students familiar with the R programming language can leverage this software. You can find details on how to download these [here](basics#installation). This is the software the instructor uses and is familiar with.
* [XLMiner](https://www.solver.com/xlminer-platform): Students that are not comfortable with R programming can use the free student version of XLMiner.  Note that the instructor is not familiar with this software so you will be on your own for troubleshooting.  You can find details on how to download this sofware [here](xlminer_install).
* [Slack](https://slack.com/) will replace e-mail and Blackboard for our course. You will receive an invitation to the [AFIT Forecasting slack team](https://afit-forecasting.slack.com). You may wish to install one of the [apps](https://slack.com/downloads/osx). 



## Policies:

1. __Attendance:__ Attendance at all class sessions and exams is mandatory for military and civilians assigned to AFIT as full-time students except for extenuating circumstances. Scheduled classes and exams are defined by the instructor and they are documented in the course schedule. Part-time students are expected to attend scheduled classes, and absences should be explained to the instructor. The student should provide advance notice, if possible. (References: Student Handbook, Graduate School Catalog)
2. __Academic Integrity:__ All students must adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity. Students are prohibited from engaging in plagiarism, cheating, misrepresentation, or any other act constituting a lack of academic integrity. Failure on the part of any individual to practice academic integrity is not condoned and will not be tolerated. Individuals who violate this policy are subject to adverse administrative action including disenrollment from school and disciplinary action. Individuals subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be prosecuted under it. Violations by government civilian employees may result in administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws. (References: Student Handbook, ENOI 36 – 107, *Academic Integrity*)
3. __Academic Grievance:__ AFIT and the Graduate School of Engineering and Management affirm the right of each student to resolve grievances with the Institution. Students are guaranteed the right of fair hearing and appeal in all matters of judgment of academic performance. Procedures are detailed in ENOI 36 – 138, *Student Academic Performance Appeals*.
4. __Testing Policy:__ This is a project-based course. Consequently there will be no midterm or final exam.
5. __Late Assignments and Make-Ups:__ Late submissions will not be accepted.
6. __Tentative Plan:__ The course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.
