This course requires completion of an individual project that implements the methods presented in the class.  The intent of the project is to apply one or multiple concepts learned within the class to an actual data set in order to perform knowledge discovery.  The project must be approved by Dr. Boehmke or LTC Smith NLT Friday, 6 October 2017.  Students may use an application within their thesis project for work within this class.  The real world data set must be something with text, and can be either pre-formatted or something in textual form.  At a bare minimum, the text should include more than 5,000 words and should be in English.  While these requirements are minimums, the intent is that the problem is analyzed according to the concepts presented in this course and that the results are articulated in a clear manner.
