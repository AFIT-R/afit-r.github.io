title: Additional Resources for Writing Functions

Functions are a fundamental building block of R and writing functions is a core activity of an R programmer. It represents the key step of the transition from a mere “user” to a developer who creates new functionality for R.  As a result, its important to turn your existing, informal knowledge of functions into a rigorous understanding of what functions are and how they work.  A few additional resources that can help you get to the next step of understanding functions include:

* [Hadley Wickham's Advanced R book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html)
* [Roger Peng's R Programming for Data Science book](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming)
* [DataCamp's Intermediate R course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r?utm_source=functions_r_tutorial_post&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=functions_r_tutorial_post)
* [Coursera's R Programming course](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog)
