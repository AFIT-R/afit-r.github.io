Looping is similiar to creating functions in that they are merely a means to automate a certain multi step process by organizing sequences of R expressions. R consists of several loop control statements which allow you to perform repetititve code processes with different intentions and allow these automated expressions to naturally respond to features of your data. Consequently, learning these loop control statements will go a long ways in reducing code redundancy and becoming a more efficient data wrangler.
