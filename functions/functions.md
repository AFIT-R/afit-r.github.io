title: Writing Functions

R is a functional programming language, meaning that everything you do is basically built on functions.  However, moving beyond simply *using* pre-built functions to *writing* your own functions is when your capabilities really start to take off and your code development/writing takes on a new level of efficiency. Functions allow you to reduce code duplication by automating a generalized task to be applied recursively. Whenever you catch yourself repeating a function or copy and pasting code there is a good change that you should write a function to eliminate the redundancies.  

Unfortunately, due to their abstractness, grasping the idea of writing functions (let alone writing them well) can take some time. However, in this section I provide you with the basic knowledge of how functions operate in R to get you started on the right path. To do this, I first outline when you should write functions. I then cover the general components of functions, specifying function arguments, scoping and evaluation rules, managing function outputs, and handling invalid parameters in the *Understanding functions* section. I then illustrate how you can save & source your own functions for reuse. Lastly, I offer some additional resources that will help you learn more about functions in R.
