The first step to any data analysis process is to *get* the data.  Data can come from many sources but two of the most common include text and Excel files.  This section covers how to import data into R by reading data from common [text files](#csv) and [Excel spreadsheets](#excel).  In addition, I cover how to load data from [saved R object files](#robject) for holding or transferring data that has been processed in R.  In addition to the the commonly used base R functions to perform data importing, I will also cover functions from the popular [`readr`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/readr/), [`xlsx`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/xlsx/), and [`readxl`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/readxl/) packages.
