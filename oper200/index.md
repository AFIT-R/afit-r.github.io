### Course Description 

This short course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to the R programming language to provide students with the fundamental programming skills required to start their journey to becoming a modern day data analyst.

### Course Objectives
Upon successfully completing this course, students will:

- Be up and running with R
- Understand the different types of data R can work with
- Understand the different structures in which R holds data
- Be able Import data into R
- Perform basic data wrangling activities with R
- Compute basic descriptive statistics with R
- Visualize their data with base R and ggplot graphics


### Structure of Class Time 

The seven in-class sessions will consist of live coding by the instructor and hands on programming by the students. The hands on practice will be sequential in which students will practice applying code as it is learned.
