We did a really brief comparison of a few notable data science
  
programs for a grant submission we were working on. I thought it wasÂ pretty fascinating, so I'm posting it here. A couple of notes about the table.

1. Our program can be taken for free, which includes assessments. If you want the official certificate and to take the capstone you pay the above costs.

2. Udacity's program can also be taken for free, but if you want the official certificate, assessments, or tutoring you pay the above costs.

3. The asterisks denote programs where you get an official master's degree.

4. The MOOC programs (Udacity's and ours) offer the more flexibility in
  
the terms of student schedules. Ours is the most flexible with courses
  
running every month. The in person programs having the least
  
flexibility but obviously the most direct instructor time.

5) The programs are all quite different in the terms of focus, design,
  
student requirements, admissions, instruction, cost and value.

6) As far as we know, ours is the only one where every bit of lecture
  
content has been open sourced (<https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization>)
