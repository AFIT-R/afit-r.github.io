Yesterday [my data sharing policy](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) went a little bit viral. It hit the front page of Hacker News and was a trending repo on Github. I was [reading the comments on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6793291) and came across this gem:

> So, while I can imagine there are good Frequentists Statisticians out there, I insist that frequentism itself is bogus.

This is the extension of a long standing debate about the relative merits of [frequentist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) and [Bayesian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) statistical methods. It is interesting that I largely only see one side of the debate being played out these days. The Bayesian zealots have it in for the frequentists in a big way. The Hacker News comments are one example, but [here](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2012/05/10/criticism-1-of-nhst-good-tools-for-individual-researchers-are-not-good-tools-for-research-communities/) [are](http://www.entsophy.net/blog/?p=200) a [Yesterday [my data sharing policy](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing) went a little bit viral.

Interestingly, even the "popular geek press" is getting in the game.

  I think it probably deserves a longer post but here are my thoughts on statistical zealotry:
</p>

  1. <span style="line-height: 16px;">User effect >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Philosophy effect. The person doing the statistics probably matters more than the statistical philosophy. I would prefer Andrew Gelman analyzed my data than a lot of frequentists. Similarly, I'd prefer that John Storey analyzed my data than a lot of Bayesians. </span>
  2. I agree with Noahpinion that this is likely mostly a [philosophy battle](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/bayesian-vs-frequentist-is-there-any.html) than a real practical applications battle.
  3. I like [Rob Kass's idea](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.2895v2.pdf) that we should move away from frequentist vs. Bayesian to pragmatism. I think most real applied statisticians have already done this, if for no other reason than being pragmatic helps you get things done.
  4. [Papers like this one](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/10/28/1313476110) that claim total victory for one side or the other all have one thing in common: they rarely use real data to verify their claims. The real world is messy and one approach never wins all the time.

My final thought on this matter is: never trust people with an agenda bearing extreme counterexamples.
