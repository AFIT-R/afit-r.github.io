I recently was contacted for an interview about the curse of dimensionality. During the course of the conversation, I realized how hard it is to explain the curse to a general audience. One of the best descriptions I could come up with was trying to describe sampling from a unit line, square, cube, etc. and taking samples with side length fixed. You would capture fewer and fewer points. As I was saying this, I realized it is a pretty bad way to explain the curse of dimensionality in words. But there was potentially a cool data visualization that would illustrate the idea. I went to my student [Prasad](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~prpatil/), our resident interactive viz design expert to see if he could build it for me. He came up with this cool Shiny app where you can simulate a number of points (n) and then fix a side length for 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, and 4-D and see how many points you capture in a cube of that length in that dimension. You can find the [full app here](https://prpatil.shinyapps.io/cod_app/) or check it out on the blog here:
