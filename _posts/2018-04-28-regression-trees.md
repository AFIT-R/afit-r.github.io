Basic ___regression trees___ partition a data set into smaller groups and then fit a simple model (constant) for each subgroup. Unfortunately, a single tree model tends to be highly unstable and a poor predictor.  However, by  bootstrap aggregating (___bagging___) regression trees, this technique can become quite powerful and effective.  Moreover, this provides the fundamental basis of more complex tree-based models such as _random forests_ and _gradient boosting machines_. This [latest tutorial](https://afit-r.github.io/regression_trees) will get you started with regression trees and bagging.
