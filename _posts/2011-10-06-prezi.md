<a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ajaffe/" target="_blank">Andrew Jaffe</a> pointed me to <a href="http://prezi.com/" target="_blank">prezi.com</a>. It looks like a new way of making presentations. Andrew made an example <a href="http://prezi.com/ft-_thkdllaf/dna-methylation/?auth_key=d9ae396295709050aa1bcb5f40b1665483f9c414" target="_blank">here</a> in just a couple of minutes. <a href="http://prezi.com/ftv9hvziwqi2/coca-cola-company/" target="_blank">Here</a> is one about Coca-Cola.

Things I like: 

  1. I go to a lot of Beamer/Powerpoint talks, these presentations at least look different and could be interesting. 
  2. It is cool how it is easy to arrange slides in a non-linear order and potentially avoid clicking forward a few slides then back a few slides
  3. I also like how the &#8220;global picture&#8221; of the talk can be shown in a display. 

Things I&#8217;m not worried about:

  1. All the zooming and panning might start to drive people nuts, like slide transitions in powerpoint. 
  2. There is serious potential for confusing presentations, organization is already a problem with some talks. 
  3. There is potential for people to spend too much time on making the prezi look cool and less on content. 

**Update:** From the comments <span>Abhijit points out that David Smith put together a presentation on the R ecosystem using Prezi. Check it out <a href="http://prezi.com/s1qrgfm9ko4i/the-r-ecosystem/" target="_blank">here</a>.</span>
