You can now see profiles of famous scientists on Google Scholar citations. Here are links to a few of them (via Ben L.). <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6kEXBa0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Von Neumann</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qc6CJjYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Einstein</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xJaxiEEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Newton</a>, <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B7vSqZsAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Feynman</a>

But their impact on science pales in comparison (with the possible exception of Newton) to the impact of one statistician: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher" target="_blank">R.A. Fisher</a>. Many of the concepts he developed are so common and are considered so standard, that he is never cited/credited. Here are some examples of things he invented along with a conservative number of citations they would have received calculated via Google Scholar*. 

  1. P-values - **3 million citations**
  2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) - **1.57 million citations**
  3. Maximum likelihood estimation - **1.54 million citations**
  4. Fisher&#8217;s linear discriminant **62,400 citations**
  5. Randomization/permutation tests **37,940 citations**
  6. Genetic linkage analysis **298,000 citations**
  7. Fisher information **57,000 citations**
  8. Fisher&#8217;s exact test **237,000 citations**

A couple of notes:

  1. These are seriously conservative estimates, since I only searched for a few variants on some key words
  2. These numbers are **BIG**, there isn&#8217;t another scientist in the ballpark. The guy who wrote the &#8220;<a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/280/28/e25.full" target="_blank">most highly cited paper</a>&#8221; got 228,441 citations on GS. His next most cited paper? <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=YCS0XAcAAAAJ&oi=sra" target="_blank">3,000 citations</a>. Fisher has at least 5 papers with more citations than his best one. 
  3. <a href="http://archive.sciencewatch.com/sept-oct2003/sw_sept-oct2003_page2.htm" target="_blank">This page</a> says Bert Vogelstein has the most citations of any person over the last 30 years. If you add up the number of citations to his top 8 papers on GS, you get 57,418. About as many as to the Fisher information matrix. 

I think this really speaks to a couple of things. One is that Fisher invented some of the most critical concepts in statistics. The other is the breadth of impact of statistical ideas across a range of disciplines. In any case, I would be hard pressed to think of another scientist who has influenced a greater range or depth of scientists with their work.
