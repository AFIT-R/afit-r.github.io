Not sure how I missed this, but the Linux Foundation just announced the [R Consortium](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/06/linux-foundation-announces-r-consortium-support-millions-users) for supporting the "world’s most popular language for analytics and data science and support the rapid growth of the R user community". From the Linux Foundation:

> The R language is used by statisticians, analysts and data scientists to unlock value from data. It is a free and open source programming language for statistical computing and provides an interactive environment for data analysis, modeling and visualization. The R Consortium will complement the work of the R Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Austria that maintains the language. The R Consortium will focus on user outreach and other projects designed to assist the R user and developer communities.
> 
> Founding companies and organizations of the R Consortium include The R Foundation, Platinum members Microsoft and RStudio; Gold member TIBCO Software Inc.; and Silver members Alteryx, Google, HP, Mango Solutions, Ketchum Trading and Oracle.
