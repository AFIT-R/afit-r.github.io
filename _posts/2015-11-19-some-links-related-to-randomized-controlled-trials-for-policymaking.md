  <p>
    In response to <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2015/11/17/why-are-randomized-trials-not-used-by-policymakers/">my previous post</a>, <a href="https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/faculty/avi-feller">Avi Feller</a> sent me these links related to efforts promoting the use of RCTs  and evidence-based approaches for policymaking:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
       The theme of this year's just-concluded APPAM conference (the national public policy research organization) was "evidence-based policymaking," with a headline panel on using experiments in policy (see <a href="http://www.appam.org/events/fall-research-conference/2015-fall-research-conference-information/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.appam.org/2015appam-student-summary-using-experiments-for-evidence-based-policy-lessons-from-the-private-sector/" target="_blank">here</a>).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Jeff Liebman has written extensively about the use of randomized experiments in policy (see <a href="http://govinnovator.com/ten_year_challenge/" target="_blank">here</a> for a recent interview).
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The White House now has an entire office devoted to running randomized trials to improve government performance (the so-called "nudge unit"). Check out their recent annual report <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/sbst_2015_annual_report_final_9_14_15.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      JPAL North America just launched a major initiative to help state and local governments run randomized trials (see <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/about-j-pal/news/j-pal-north-america-state-and-local-innovation-initiative-release" target="_blank">here</a>).
    </li>
