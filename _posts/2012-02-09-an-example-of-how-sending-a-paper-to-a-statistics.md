In a <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/14218411483/dear-editors-associate-editors-referees-please-reject" target="_blank">previous post</a> I complained about statistics journals taking way too long rejecting papers. Today I am complaining because even when everything goes right &#8212;better than <strike>above</strike> average review time (for statistics), useful and insightful comments from reviewers&#8212; we can come out losing.

In May 2011 we submitted a paper on <a href="http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/01/24/biostatistics.kxr054.long" target="_blank">removing GC bias from RNAseq</a> data to Biostatistics. It was published on December 27. However, we were scooped by <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/480/abstract" target="_blank">this BMC Bioinformatics paper</a> published ten days earlier despite being submitted three months later and accepted 11 days after ours. The competing paper has already earned the &#8220;highly accessed&#8221; distinction. The two papers, both statistics papers, are very similar, yet I am afraid more people will read the one that was finished second but published first.

Note that B<span>iostatistics is one of the fastest stat journals out there. I don&#8217;t blame the journal at all here. We statisticians have to change our culture when it comes to reviews.</span>
