Clustering is a broad set of techniques for finding subgroups of observations within a data set. When we cluster observations, we want observations in the same group to be similar and observations in different groups to be dissimilar. Clustering allows us to identify which observations (i.e. customers, students, states) are alike, and potentially categorize them therein. Check out our new tutorials covering [k-means](https://afit-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering) and [hierarchical](https://afit-r.github.io/hc_clustering) clustering.
