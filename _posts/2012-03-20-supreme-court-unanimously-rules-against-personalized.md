Just a few minutes ago the Supreme Court released their <a href="http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/Mayo%20Opinion.pdf" target="_blank">decision</a> in the Mayo case, see <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/14135999782/the-supreme-courts-interpretation-of-statistical" target="_blank">here</a> for the Simply Statistics summary of the case. The court ruled unanimously that the personalized medicine test could not be patented. Such a strong ruling likely has major implications going forward for the field of personalized medicine. At the end of the day, this decision was based on an interpretation of statistical correlation. Stay tuned for a special in-depth analysis in the next couple of days that will get into the details of the ruling and the implications for personalized medicine.Â
