Jeff recently posted <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/15182715327/list-of-cities-states-with-open-data-help-me-find" target="_blank">links to data from cities and states</a>. He and I wrote <a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/simplystats/gunviolations.R" target="_blank">R code</a> that plots gun offender locations for Baltimore. Specifically we plot the locations that appear on <a href="http://data.baltimorecity.gov/Crime/Gun-Offenders/aivj-4x23" target="_blank">this table</a>. I added locations of the Baltimore neighborhoods where most of our Hopkins colleagues live as well as the location of the medical institutions where we work. Note the corridor with no points between the West side (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barksdale_Organization" target="_blank">Barksdale</a> territory) and East side (<a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/simplystats/propjoekima.jpg" target="_blank">Prop Joe</a> territory). Not surprisingly, academics don&#8217;t live near the gun offenders.Â
