  1. Harvard Business school is getting in on the fun, calling the data scientist the <a href="http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/ar/1" target="_blank">sexy profession for the 21st century</a>. Although I am a little worried that by the time it gets into a Harvard Business document, the hype may be outstripping the real promise of the discipline. Still, good news for statisticians! (via Rafa via Francesca D.&#8217;s Facebook feed). 
  2. The counterpoint is <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2012/08/31/the-data-scientist-will-be-replaced-by-tools/" target="_blank">this article</a> which suggests that data scientists might be able to be replaced by tools/software. I think this is also a bit too much hype for my tastes. Certain things will definitely be automated and we may even end up with <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/30315018436/a-deterministic-statistical-machine" target="_blank">a deterministic statistical machine</a> or two. But there will continually be new problems to solve which require the expertise of people with data analysis skills and good intuition (link via Samara K.)
  3. A bunch of websites are popping up where you can sign up and have people take your online courses for you. I&#8217;m not going to give them the benefit of a link, but they aren&#8217;t hard to find these days. The thing I don&#8217;t understand is, if it is a free online course, why have someone else take it for you? It&#8217;s free, its in your spare time, and the bar for passing is pretty low (links via Sherri R. redacted)&#8230;.
  4. Maybe mostly useful for me, but for other people with Tumblr blogs, here is a way to <a href="http://is-r.tumblr.com/post/31792415116/embedding-latex-in-tumblr" target="_blank">insert Latex</a>.
  5. Brian Caffo <a href="http://samsiatrtp.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/brian-caffo-shares-his-impression-of-the-massive-datasets-opening-workshop/" target="_blank">shares his impressions</a> of the SAMSI massive data workshop.  He raises an important issue which definitely deserves more discussion: should we be focusing on specific or general problems? Worth a read. 
  6. For the people into self-tracking, Chris V. <a href="http://myyearofdata.wordpress.com/2012/09/18/bootytracking/" target="_blank">points to an app</a> created by the University of Indiana that lets people track their sexual activity. The most interesting thing about that app is how it highlights a key and I suppose often overlooked issue with analyzing self-tracking data. Despite the size of these data sets, they are still definitely biased samples. It&#8217;s only a brave few who will tell the University of Indiana all about their sex life.
