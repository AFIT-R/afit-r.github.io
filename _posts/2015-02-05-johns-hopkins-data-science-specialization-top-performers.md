_Editor's note: The Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization is the largest data science program in the world.  [Brian](http://www.bcaffo.com/), [Roger](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/), and [myself ](http://jtleek.com/) conceived the program at the beginning of January 2014 , then built, recorded, and launched the classes starting in April 2014 with the help of [Ira](https://twitter.com/iragooding).  Since April 2014 we have enrolled 1.76 million student and awarded 71,589 Signature Track verified certificates. The first capstone class ran in October - just 7 months after the first classes launched and 4 months after all classes were running. Despite this incredibly short time frame 917 students finished all 9 classes and enrolled in the Capstone Course. 478 successfully completed the course._

When we first announced the the Data Science Specialization, we said that the top performers would be profiled here on Simply Statistics. Well, that time has come, and we've got a very impressive group of participants that we want to highlight. These folks have successfully completed all nine MOOCs in the specialization and earned top marks in our first capstone session with [SwiftKey](http://swiftkey.com/en/). We had the pleasure of meeting some of them last week in a video conference, and we were struck by their insights and expertise. Check them out below.

He has a background in computer science with a strong interest in machine learning and its applications in quantitative modeling.

### **Why did you take the JHU Data Science Specialization?**

I was fortunate to have done the first Machine Learning course taught by Prof. Andrew Ng at the launch of Coursera in 2012, which really piqued my interest in the topic. The next course I did on Coursera was Prof. Roger Peng's Computing For Data Analysis which introduced me to R. I realized that R was ideally suited for the quantitative modeling work I was doing. When I learned about the range of topics that the JHU DSS would cover - from the best practices in tidying and transforming data to modeling, analysis and visualization - I did not hesitate to sign up. Learning how to do all of this in an ecosystem built around R has been a huge plus.

### **What are you most proud of doing as part of the JHU Data Science Specialization?**

I am quite pleased with the web apps I built which utilize the concepts learned during the track. One of my apps visualizes and compares historical stock performance with other stocks and market benchmarks after querying the data directly from web resources. Another one showcases a predictive typing engine that dynamically predicts the next few words to use and append, as the user types a sentence. The process of building these apps provided a fantastic learning experience. Also, for the first time I built something that even my near and dear ones could use and appreciate, which is terrific.

### **How are you planning on using your Data Science Specialization Certificate?**

The broad skill set developed through this specialization could be applied across multiple domains. My current focus is on building robust quantitative models for systematic trading strategies that could learn and adapt to changing market environments. This would involve the application of machine learning techniques among other skills learned during the specialization. Using R and Shiny to interactively analyze the results would be tremendously useful.

### **Why did you take the JHU Data Science Specialization?**

There are many data science MOOCs, but usually they are independent 4-6 week courses. The JHU Data Science Specialization was the first offering of a series of courses that build upon each other.

### **What are you most proud of doing as part of the JHU Data Science Specialization?**

Creating a working text prediction app without any prior NLP knowledge and only minimal assistance from instructors.

### **How are you planning on using your Data Science Specialization Certificate?**

Knowledge and experience are the most valuable things gained from the Data Science Specialization. As they can't be easily shown to future employers, the certificate can be a good indicator for them. Unfortunately there is neither an issue data nor a verification link on the certificate, therefore it will be interesting to see how valuable it really will be.

&nbsp;

By the time I enrolled in the JHU data science specialization, I was an undergraduate student in The Hong Kong Polytechnic university. Before that, I read some data mining books, feel excited about the content, but I never get to implement any of the algorithms because I barely have any programming skill. After taking this series of courses, now I am able to analyze the web content which is related to my research using R.

### **Why did you take the JHU Data Science Specialization?**

I took this series of courses as a challenge to me. I would like to see whether my interest can support me through 9 courses and 1 capstone project. And I do want to learn more in this field. This specialization is different from other data mining or machine learning class in that it covers the entire process including the Git, R, R-Markdown, shiny etc, and I think these are necessary skills too.

**What are you most proud of doing as part of the JHU Data Science Specialization?**

Getting my word prediction app to respond in 0.05 seconds is already exiting, and one of the reviewer says "congratulations your engine came up with the most correct prediction among those I reviewed: 3 out of 5, including one that stumped every one else : "child might stick her finger or a foreign object into an electrical (outlet)". I guess that's the part I am most proud of.

**How are you planning on using your Data Science Specialization Certificate?**

It definitely goes in my CV for future job hunting.
