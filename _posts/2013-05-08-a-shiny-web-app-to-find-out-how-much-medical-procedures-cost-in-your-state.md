Today the [front page of the Huffington Post featured](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html) the [Today the [front page of the Huffington Post featured](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html) the](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html) that shows the cost of many popular procedures broken down by hospital. We here at Simply Statistics think you should be able to explore these data more easily. So we asked [Today the [front page of the Huffington Post featured](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html) the [Today the [front page of the Huffington Post featured](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/08/hospital-prices-cost-differences_n_3232678.html) the](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html) that shows the cost of many popular procedures broken down by hospital. We here at Simply Statistics think you should be able to explore these data more easily. So we asked](http://biostat.jhsph.edu/~jmuschel/) to help us build a Shiny App that allows you to interact with these data. You can choose your state and your procedure and see how much the procedure costs at hospitals in your state. It takes a second to load because it is a lot of data....

Here are some screenshots for intracranial hemmhorage for the US and for Idaho.
