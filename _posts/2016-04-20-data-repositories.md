title: As a data analyst the best data repositories are the ones with the least features

Lately, for a range of projects I have been working on I have needed to obtain data from previous publications. There is a growing list of data repositories where data is made available. General purpose data sharing sites include:

* The [open science framework](https://osf.io/)
* The [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
* [Figshare](https://figshare.com/)
* [Datadryad](https://datadryad.org/)

There are also a host of field-specific data sharing sites.One thing that I find a little frustrating about these sites is that they add a lot of bells and whistles. For example I wanted to download a [p-value data set](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/6FMTT3) from Dataverse (just to pick on one, but most repositories have similar issues). I go to the page and click `Download` on the data set I want.

Then I have to accept terms:

Then I have to

Then the data set is downloaded. But it comes from a button that doesn't allow me to get the direct link. There is an [R package](https://github.com/ropensci/dvn) that you can use to download dataverse data, but again not with direct links to the data sets. 

This is a similar system to many data repositories where there is a multi-step process to downloading data rather than direct links.

But as a data analyst I often find that I want: 

* To be able to find a data set with some minimal search terms
* Find the data set in .csv or tab delimited format via a direct link
* Have the data set be available both as raw and processed versions
* The processed version will either be one or many [tidy data sets](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10). 

As a data analyst I would rather have all of the data stored as direct links and ideally as csv files. Then you don't need to figure out a specialized package, an API, or anything else. You just use `read.csv` directly using the URL in R and you are off to the races. It also makes it easier to point to which data set you are using. So I find the best data repositories are the ones with the least features.
