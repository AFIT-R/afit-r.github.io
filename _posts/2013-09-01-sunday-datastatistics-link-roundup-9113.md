  1. <span style="line-height: 16px;">There has been a lot of discussion of the importance of open access on Twitter. I am 100% in favor of open access (<a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2011/11/03/free-access-publishing-is-awesome-but-expensive-how/">I do wish it was less expensive</a>), but I also think that sometimes people lose sight of other important issues for junior scientists that go beyond open access. Dr. Isis has a<a href="http://isisthescientist.com/2013/08/28/the-morality-of-open-access-vs-increasing-diversity/"> great example</a> of this on her blog. </span>
  2. Sherri R. has a [great list of resources](http://drsherrirose.com/resources) for stats minded folks at the undergrad, grad, and faculty levels.
  3. There he goes again. Another [awesome piece by Rafa](http://www.80grados.net/arce-y-la-estrella/) on someone else's blog. It is in Spanish but the google translate does ok. Be sure to check out questions 3 and 4.
  4. A really nice summary of Nate Silver's talk at JSM and a post-talk interview (in video format) [are available here.](http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5133141/Nate-Silver-Wha%20t-I-need-from-statisticians.html) Pair with this [awesome Onion piece](http://www.theonion.com/articles/nate-silver-vows-to-teach-chris-berman-how-to-read,33610/) (both links via Marie D.)
  5. [A really nice post](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/08/a-few-words-about-math.html) that made the rounds in the economics blogosphere talking about the use of mathematics in econ. This seems like a pretty relevant quote, "Instead, it was just some random thing that someone made up and wrote down because A) it was tractable to work with, and B) it sounded plausible enough so that most other economists who looked at it tended not to make too much of a fuss."
  6. More on [hiring technical people](http://blog.alinelerner.com/silicon-valley-hiring-is-not-a-meritocracy/). This is related to Google saying their [brainteaser interview questions don't work](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/06/20/googles-brainteasers-that-dont-work-and-johns-hopkins-biostatistics-data-analysis/). Check out [the list](http://blog.alinelerner.com/lessons-from-a-years-worth-of-hiring-data/) here of things that this person found useful in hiring technical people that could be identified easily.  I like how typos and grammatical errors were one of the best predictors.
