  1. A [cool data visualization](http://diabetesvis.herokuapp.com/diabetes/dashboard) for blood glucose levels for diabetic individuals. This kind of interactive visualization can help people see where/when major health issues arise for chronic diseases. This was a class project by Jeff Heer's Stanford CS448B students Ben Rudolph and Reno Bowen (twitter @RenoBowen). Speaking of interactive visualizations, I also got [this link](http://dexvis.com/doku.php) from Patrick M. It looks like a way to build interactive graphics and my understanding is it is compatible with R data frames, worth checking out (plus, Dex is a good name).
  2. Here is an [interesting review](http://mathbabe.org/2012/12/20/nate-silver-confuses-cause-and-effect-ends-up-defending-corruption/) of Nate Silver's book. The interesting thing about the review is that it doesn't criticize the statistical content, but criticizes the belief that people only use data analysis for good. This is an interesting theme we've seen before. Gelman also [reviews the review](http://andrewgelman.com/2012/12/two-reviews-of-nate-silvers-new-book-from-kaiser-fung-and-cathy-oneil/).
  3. It's a little late now, but this tool seems useful for folks who want to know [whatdoineedonmyfinal](http://www.whatdoineedonmyfinal.com/)?
  4. A list of the [best open data releases of 2012](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2012/12/best-open-data-releases-2012/4200/). I particularly like the rat sightings in New York and think the Baltimore fixed speed cameras (which I have a habit of running afoul of).
  5. A [map of data scientists](http://giladlotan.com/blog/mapping-twitters-python-data-science-communities/) on Twitter.  Unfortunately, since we don't have "data scientist" in our Twitter description, Simply Statistics does not appear. I'm sure we would have been central....
  6. Here is [an interesting paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v3/n12/full/ncomms2292.html?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureComms) where some investigators developed a technology that directly reads out a bar chart of the relevant quantities. They mention this means there is no need for statistical analysis. I wonder if the technology also reads out error bars.
