If you&#8217;re interested in know what the air quality looks like in Beijing China, the US Embassy there has a particulate matter monitor on its roof that tweets the level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) every hour (see <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beijingair" target="_blank">@BeijingAir</a>). In case you&#8217;re not used to staring at PM2.5 values all the time, let me provide some context.

The US National Ambient Air Quality Standard for the 24-hour average PM2.5 level is 35 mcg/m^3. The twitter feed shows hourly values, so you can&#8217;t compare it directly to the US NAAQS (you&#8217;d have to take the average of 24 values), but the levels are nevertheless pretty high.

For example, here&#8217;s the hourly time series plot of one 24-hour period in March of 2010:

The red and blue lines show the average and maximum 24-hour value for Wake County, NC for the period 2000-2006 (I made this plot when I was giving a talk in Raleigh).

So, things could be worse here in the US, but remember that there&#8217;s no real evidence of a threshold for PM2.5, so even levels here are potentially harmful. But if you&#8217;re traveling to China anytime soon, might want to bring a respirator.
