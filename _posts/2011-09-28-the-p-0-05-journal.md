I want to start a journal called &#8220;P>0.05&#8221;. This journal will publish all the negative results in science. These would also be stored in a database. Think of all the great things we could do with this. We could, for example, plot p-value histograms for different disciplines. I bet most would have a flat distribution. We could also do it by specific association. A paper comes out saying <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2007/January08/Pages/Chocolatecausesweakbones.aspx" target="_blank">chocolate is linked to weaker bones</a>? Check the histogram and keep eating chocolate. Any publishers interested?Â
