Consider this exercise. Come up with a list of the top 5 people that you think are really good at data analysis.

There&#8217;s one catch: They have to be people that you&#8217;ve never met nor have had any sort of personal interaction with (e.g. email, chat, etc.). So basically people who have written papers/books you&#8217;ve read or have given talks you&#8217;ve seen or that you know through other publicly available information. Who comes to mind? It&#8217;s okay to include people who are no longer living.

The other day I was thinking about the people who I think are really good at data analysis and it occurred to me that they were all people I knew. So I started thinking about people that I don&#8217;t know (and there are many) but are equally good at data analysis. This turned out to be much harder than I thought. And I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not because they don&#8217;t exist, it&#8217;s just because I think good data analysis chops are hard to evaluate from afar using the standard methods by which we evaluate people.

I think there are a few reasons. First, people who are great at data analysis are likely not publishing papers or being productive in a manner that I, an outsider, would be able to observe. If they&#8217;re working at a pharmaceutical company working on a new drug or at some fancy new startup company, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m ever going to know about it unless I&#8217;m directly involved.

Another reason is that even for people who are well-known scientists or statisticians, the products they produce don&#8217;t really highlight the difficulties overcome in data analysis. For example, many good papers in the statistics literature will describe a new method with brief reference to the data that inspired the method&#8217;s development. In those cases, the data analysis usually appears obvious, as most things do _after_ they&#8217;ve been done. Furthermore, papers usually exclude all the painful details about merging, cleaning, and inspecting the data as well as all the other things you tried that didn&#8217;t work. Papers in the substantive literature have a similar problem, which is that they focus on a scientific problem of interest and the analysis of the data is secondary.

As skills in data analysis become more important, it seems odd to me that we don&#8217;t have a great way to evaluate a person&#8217;s ability to do it as we do in other areas.
