A number of people seem to have objected to my <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/26020538368/the-price-of-skepticism" target="_blank">post quoting Carl Sagan about skepticism</a> (hi Paramita!) and I appreciate the comments. However, I wanted to clarify why I liked the quotation. I think in order to be successful in science three things are necessary:

  1. A healthy skepticism
  2. An original idea
  3. Quite a bit of <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/23928890537/schlep-blindness-in-statistics" target="_blank">grit and moxie</a>

I find that too often, people consciously or unconsciously stop at (A). In fact some people make an entire career doing (A) but it&#8217;s not one that I can personally appreciate.

What we need more of is skepticism coupled with new ideas, not pure skepticism.
