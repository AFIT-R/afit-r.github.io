  1. An interesting blog post about the <a href="http://caseybergman.wordpress.com/2012/07/31/top-n-reasons-to-do-a-ph-d-or-post-doc-in-bioinformaticscomputational-biology/" target="_blank">top N reasons</a> to do a Ph.D. in bioinformatics or computational biology. A couple of things that I find interesting and could actually be said of any program in biostatistics as well are: computing is the key skill of the 21st century and computational skills are highly transferrable. Via Andrew J. 
  2. Here is an interesting <a href="http://blog.noupsi.de/post/28896819324/why-are-americans-so" target="_blank">auto-complete map</a> of the United States where the prompt was, &#8220;Why is [state] so&#8221;. It seems like using the Google auto-complete functions can lead to all sorts of humorous data, <a href="http://xkcd.com/715/" target="_blank">xkcd</a> has used it as a data source a couple of times in the past. By the way, the person(s) who think Idaho is boring haven&#8217;t been to the right parts of Idaho. (via Rafa). 
  3. One of my all-time favorite statistics quotes appears <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2012/08/03/opinion/brooks-the-credit-illusion.xml" target="_blank">in this column</a> by David Brooks: &#8220;&#8230;<span>what God hath woven together, even multiple regression analysis cannot tear asunder.&#8221; It seems like the perfect quote for any study that attempts to build a predictive model for a complicated phenomenon where only limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms are known. </span>
  4. <span>I&#8217;ve been reading up a lot on how to summarize and communicate risk. At the moment, I&#8217;ve been following a lot of David Spiegelhalter&#8217;s stuff, and really liked this <a href="http://plus.maths.org/content/understanding-uncertainty-2845-ways-spinning-risk-0" target="_blank">30,000 foot view summary</a>.</span>
  5. <span>It is interesting how often you see R popping up in random places these days. Here is a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-actually-predicts-the-stock-market-2012-8" target="_blank">blog post</a> with some clearly R-created plots that appeared on Business Insider about predicting the stock-market. </span>
  6. <span>Roger and I had a post on MOOC&#8217;s this week from the perspective of faculty teaching the courses. For a more departmental/administrative level view, be sure to re-read Rafa&#8217;s post on the <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/10764298034/the-future-of-graduate-education" target="_blank">future of graduate education</a>. </span>
