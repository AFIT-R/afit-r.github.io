NYC mayor-elect Bill de Blasio [is expected](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/nyregion/de-blasio-to-name-bratton-as-new-york-police-commissioner.html?smid=fb-nytimes&WT.z_sma=NY_DBT_20131205&bicmp=AD&bicmlukp=WT.mc_id&bicmst=%20201385874000000&bicmet=%20201388638800000) to name William J. Bratton to lead the NYPD. Bratton has been commissioner before (1994-1996) so I was curious to see the crime rates during his tenure, which was within the period that saw an impressive drop (1990-2010). Here is the graph of violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants for <del>NYC</del> NY state for year 1965-2012 (divided by commissioner). Will Bratton be able to continue the trend? The graph suggests to me that they have hit a "floor" (1960s levels!).
