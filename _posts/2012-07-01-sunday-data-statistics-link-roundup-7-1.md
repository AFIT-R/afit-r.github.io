  1. A <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/vb8vs/eli5_what_exactly_is_obamacare_and_what_did_it/c530lfx" target="_blank">really nice </a>explanation of the elements of Obamacare. <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/26138675180/obamacare-is-not-going-to-solve-the-health-care-crisis" target="_blank">Rafa&#8217;s post</a> on the new <a href="http://web.jhu.edu/administration/provost/initiatives/ihi/" target="_blank">inHealth initiative</a> Scott is leading got a lot of <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/vsltn/obamacare_is_not_going_to_solve_the_health_care/" target="_blank">comments on Reddit</a>. Some of them are funny (Rafa&#8217;s spelling got rocked) and if you get past the usual level of internet-commentary politeness, some of them seem to be really relevant - especially the comments about generalizability and the economics of health care. 
  2. From Andrew J. a <a href="http://www.yonderbiology.com/DNA_art/acgt" target="_blank">cool visualization of the human genome</a>, they are showing every base of the human genome over the course of a year. That turns out to be about 100 bases per second. I think this is a great way to show how much information is in just one human genome. It also puts the sequencing data deluge in perspective. We are now sequencing thousands of these genomes a year and its only going to get faster. 
  3. Cosma Shalizi has a <a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/920.html%20" target="_blank">nice list</a> of unsolved problems in statistics on his blog (via Edo A.). These problems primarily fall into what I call Category 1 problems in my post on <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/26068033590/motivating-statistical-projects" target="_blank">motivating statistical projects</a>. I think he has some really nice insight though and some of these problems sound like a big deal if one was able to solve them.
  4. A really provocative talk on why <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBx2Y5HhplI" target="_blank">consumers are the job creators</a>. The issue of who are the job creators seems absolutely ripe for a thorough statistical analysis. There are a thousand confounders here and my guess is that most of the work so far has been Category 2 - let&#8217;s use convenient data to make a stab at this. But a thorough and legitimate data analysis would be hugely impactful. 
  5. Your eReader is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304870304577490950051438304.html?mod=rss_Today's_Most_Popular" target="_blank">collecting data</a> about you.
