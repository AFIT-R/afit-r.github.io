I was just talking to a student who mentioned she didn't know Jenny Bryan was on Twitter. She is and she is an awesome person to follow. I also realized that I hadn't seen a good list of women on Twitter who do stats/data. So I thought I'd make one. This list is what I could make in 15 minutes based on my own feed and will, with 100% certainty, miss really people. Can you please add them in the comments and I'll update the list?
