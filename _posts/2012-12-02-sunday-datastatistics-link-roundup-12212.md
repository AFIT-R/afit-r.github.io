  1. <span style="line-height: 16px;"><a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/feature/business-quandary-use-a-competition-to-crowdsource-best-answers/?non_mobile=1">An interview</a> with Anthony Goldbloom, CEO of Kaggle. I'm not sure I'd agree with the characterization that all data scientists are: creative, curious, and competitive and certainly those characteristics aren't unique to data scientists. And I didn't know this: "We have 65,000 data scientists signed up to Kaggle, and just like with golf tournaments, we have them all ranked from 1 to 65,000." </span>
  2. <span style="line-height: 16px;">Check it out, <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/images-as-voronoi-tesselations/">art with R</a>! It's actually pretty interesting to see how they use statistical algorithms to generate different artistic styles. <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/dominant-color-palettes-with-k-means/">Here</a> are some more. </span>
  3. <span style="line-height: 16px;">Now that Ethan Perlstein's crowdfunding experiment </span><a style="line-height: 16px;" href="http://twitter.com/eperlste/status/273152039922565121">was successful</a><span style="line-height: 16px;">, other people are getting on the bandwagon. If you want to find out what kind of bacteria you have in your gut, for example, you could check out <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/ubiome">this</a>. </span>
  4. <span style="line-height: 16px;">I thought I had it rough, but apparently some data analysts spend all their time developing algorithms to <a href="http://www.p4rgaming.com/?p=481">detect penis drawings</a>!</span>
  5. <span style="line-height: 16px;">Roger was on Anderson Cooper 360 as part of the Building America segment. We can't find the video, but <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1211/27/acd.02.html">here</a> is the transcript. </span>
  6. <span style="line-height: 16px;">An interesting article on the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/11/qa-samuel-arbesman?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/halflifeoffacts">half-life of facts</a>. I think the analogy is an interesting one and certainly there is research to be done there. But I think it jumps the shark a bit when they start talking about how the moon landing was predictable, etc. I completely believe in the retrospective analysis of knowledge, but predicting things is pretty hard, especially when it is the future. </span><span style="line-height: 16px;"> </span>
