This looks like an [interesting opportunity](https://www.mozillascience.org/fellows) for grad students, postdocs, and early career researchers:

> We're looking for researchers with a passion for open source and data sharing, already working to shift research practice to be more collaborative, iterative and open. Fellows will spend 10 months starting September 2015 as community catalysts at their institutions, mentoring the next generation of open data practitioners and researchers and building lasting change in the global open science community.
> 
> Throughout their fellowship year, chosen fellows will receive training and support from Mozilla to hone their skills around open source and data sharing. They will also craft code, curriculum and other learning resources that help their local communities learn open data practices, and teach forward to their peers.

Here's what you get:

> Fellows will receive:
> 
>   * A stipend of $60,000 USD, paid in 10 monthly installments.
>   * One-time health insurance supplement for Fellows and their families, ranging from $3,500 for single Fellows to $7,000 for a couple with two or more children.
>   * One-time childcare allotment for families with children of up to $6,000.
>   * Allowance of up to $3,000 towards the purchase of laptop computer, digital cameras, recorders and computer software; fees for continuing studies or other courses, research fees or payments, to the extent related to the fellowship.
>   * All approved fellowship trips – domestic and international – are covered in full.

Deadline is August 14.
