This fall I have been asked to write seven promotion letters. Writing these takes me at least 2 hours. If it&#8217;s someone I don&#8217;t know it takes me longer because I have to read some of their papers.Â Earlier this year, I wrote one for a Biology department that took me at least 6 hours. So how many are too many? Should I set a limit? Advice and opinions in the comments would be greatly appreciated.
