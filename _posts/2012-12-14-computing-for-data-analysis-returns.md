I'm happy to announce that my course [Computing for Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata) will return to [Coursera](http://coursera.org) on January 2nd, 2013. While I had previously announced that the course would be presented again right here, it made more sense to do it again on Coursera where it is (still) free and the platform there is much richer. For those of you who missed it the last time around, this is your chance to take it and learn a little R.

I've gotten a number of emails from people who were interested in watching the videos for the course. If you just want to sit around and watch videos of me talking, I've created a set of four YouTube playlists based on the four weeks of the course:

  * [Background and getting started](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjTlxb-wKvXMUop9m0C8G5xLBzhsIDBC7)
  * [Week 1](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&feature=view_all): Background on R, data types, reading/writing data
  * [Week 2](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNnjUTX4C8IeIhPBjPkng6B&feature=view_all): Control structures, functions, apply functions, debugging tools
  * <span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjTlxb-wKvXOzI2h0F2_rYZHIXz8GWBop&feature=view_all">Week 3</a>: Plotting and simulation</span>
  * [Week 4](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjTlxb-wKvXOdzysAE6qrEBN_aSBC0LZS&feature=view_all): Regular expressions, classes and methods

The content in the YouTube playlists reflect the content from the first iteration of the course and will not reflect any new material I add to the second iteration (at least not for a little while).

I encourage everyone who is interested to enroll in the course on Coursera because there you'll have the benefit of in-video quizzes and other forms of assessment and will be able to interact with all of the great students who are also enrolled in the class.Â Also, if you're interested in signing up for Jeff Leek's [Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis) course (starts on January 22, 2013) and are not very familiar with R, I encourage you to check out Computing for Data Analysis first to get yourself up to speed.

I look forward to seeing you there!
