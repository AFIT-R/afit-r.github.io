I have written guides on [reviewing papers](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews), [sharing data](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing), Â and [writing R packages](https://github.com/jtleek/rpackages). One thing I haven't touched on until now has been writing papers. Certainly for me, and I think for a lot of students, the hardest transition in graduate school is between taking classes and doing research.

There are several hard parts to this transition including trying to find a problem, trying to find an advisor, and having a ton of unstructured time. One of the hardest things I've found is knowing (a) when to start writing your first paper and (b) how to do it. So I wrote a guide for students in my group:

<https://github.com/jtleek/firstpaper>

On how to write your first paper. It might be useful for other folks as well so I put it up on Github. Just like with the other guides I've written this is a very opinionated (read: doesn't apply to everyone) guide. I also would appreciate any feedback/pull requests people have.
