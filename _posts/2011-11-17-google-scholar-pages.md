If you want to get to know more about what we&#8217;re working on, you can check out our Google Scholar pages:

  * <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HI-I6C0AAAAJ" target="_blank">Jeff Leek</a>
  * <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nFW-2Q8AAAAJ" target="_blank">Rafael Irizarry</a>
  * <a href="http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h5wUydwAAAAJ" target="_blank">Roger Peng</a>

I&#8217;ve only been using it for a day but I&#8217;m pretty impressed by how much it picked up. My only problem so far is having to merge different versions of the same paper.
