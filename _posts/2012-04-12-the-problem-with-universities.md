I have had the following conversation a number of times recently:

  1. I want to do X. X is a lot of fun and is really interesting. Doing X involves a little of A and a little of B.
  2. We should get some students to do X also.
  3. Okay, but from where should we get the students? Students in Department of A don&#8217;t know B. Students from Department of B don&#8217;t know A.
  4. Fine, maybe we could start a program that specifically trains people in X. In this program we&#8217;ll teach them A and B. It&#8217;ll be the first program of it&#8217;s kind! Woohoo!
  5. Sure that&#8217;s great, but because there aren&#8217;t any _other_ departments of X, the graduates of our program now have to get jobs in departments of A or B. Those departments complain that students from Department of X only know a little of A (or B).
  6. Grrr. Go away.

Has anyone figured out a solution to this problem? Specifically, how do you train students to do something for which there&#8217;s no formal department/program without jeopardizing their career prospects?
