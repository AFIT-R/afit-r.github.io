In this episode, Hilary and I talk about the difficulties of
separating data analysis from its context, and Feather, a new file
format for storing tabular data. Also, we respond to some listener
questions and Hilary announces her new job.

If you have questions you’d like us to answer, you can send them to
nssdeviations @ gmail.com or tweet us at @NSSDeviations.
