  1. Jack Welch <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_welch/status/254198154260525057" target="_blank">got a little conspiracy-theory crazy</a> with the job numbers. Thomas Lumley over at StatsChat makes <a href="http://www.statschat.org.nz/2012/10/06/statistics-conspiracy-theories/" target="_blank">a pretty good case</a> for debunking the theory. I think the real take home message of Thomas&#8217; post and one worth celebrating/highlighting is that agencies that produce the jobs report do so based on a fixed and well-defined study design. Careful efforts by government statistics agencies make it hard to fudge/change the numbers. This is an underrated and hugely important component of a well-run democracy. 
  2. On a similar note Dan Gardner at the Ottawa Citizen points out that <a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/Evidence+comes+shapes+sizes/7351609/story.html" target="_blank">evidence-based policy</a> making is actually not enough. He points out the critical problem with evidence: <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/15774146480/in-the-era-of-data-what-is-a-fact" target="_blank">in the era of data what is a fact</a>? &#8220;Facts&#8221; can come from flawed or biased studies just as easily from strong studies. He suggests that a true &#8220;evidence based&#8221; administration would invest more money in research/statistical agencies. I think this is a great idea. 
  3. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444223104578038362388183092.html" target="_blank">An interesting article</a> by Ben Bernanke suggesting that an optimal approach (in baseball and in policy) is one based on statistical analysis, coupled with careful thinking about long-term versus short-term strategy. I think one of his arguments about allowing players to play even when they are struggling short term is actually a case for letting the weak law of large numbers play out. If you have a player with skill/talent, they will eventually converge to their &#8220;true&#8221; numbers. It&#8217;s also good for their confidence&#8230;.(via David Santiago).
  4. Here is another interesting <a href="http://svpow.com/2012/10/03/dear-royal-society-please-stop-lying-to-us-about-publication-times/?utm_source=social_media&utm_medium=hootsuite&utm_campaign=standard" target="_blank">peer review dust-up</a>. It explains why some journals &#8220;reject&#8221; papers when they really mean major/minor revision to be able to push down their review times. I think this highlights yet another problem with pre-publication peer review. The evidence is mounting, but I hear we may get a defense of the current system from one of the editors of this blog, so stay tuned&#8230;
  5. Several people (Sherri R., Alex N., many folks on Twitter) have pointed me to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109" target="_blank">this article</a> about gender bias in science. I initially was a bit skeptical of such a strong effect across a broad range of demographic variables. After reading the supplemental material carefully, it is clear I was wrong. It is a very well designed/executed study and suggests that there is still a strong gender bias in science, across ages and disciplines. Interestingly both men and women were biased against the female candidates. This is clearly a non-trivial problem to solve and needs a lot more work, maybe one step is to<a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/25849875593/a-specific-suggestion-to-help-recruit-retain-women" target="_blank"> make recruitment packages more flexible</a> (see the comment by Allison T. especially).
