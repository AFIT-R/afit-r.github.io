A little while ago I wrote a post on <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/18493330661/statistics-project-ideas-for-students" target="_blank">statistics projects ideas for students</a>. In honor of the first Simply Statistics Coursera offering, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata" target="_blank">Computing for Data Analysis</a>, here is a new list of student projects for folks excited about trying out those new R programming skills. Again we have rated each project with my best guess difficulty and effort required. Happy computing!

**Data Analysis**

  1. Use city data to predict areas with the highest risk for parking tickets. <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Financial/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m" target="_blank">Here </a>is the data for Baltimore. (_Difficulty: Moderate, Effort: Low/Moderate_)
  2. If you have a Fitbit with a premium account, download the data into a spreadsheet (or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gauvv2fzf623ia5/SOgEROC7jO/Current" target="_blank">get Chris&#8217;s data</a>)  Then build various predictors using the data: (a) are you running or walking, (b) are you having a good day or not, (c) did you eat well that day or not, (d) etc. For special bonus points <a href="http://myyearofdata.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">create a blog</a> with your new discoveries and share your data with the world. (_Difficulty: Depends on what you are trying to predict, Effort: Moderate with Fitbit/Jawbone/etc_.)

**Data Collection/Synthesis**

  1. Make a list of skills associated with each component of the <a href="http://www.drewconway.com/zia/?p=2378" target="_blank">Data Scientist Venn Diagram</a>. Then update the <a href="https://github.com/jtleek/datascientist/blob/master/dataScientist.R" target="_blank">data scientist R function</a> described in <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/11271228367/datascientist" target="_blank">this post</a> to ask a set of questions, then plot people on the diagram. Hint, check out the readline() function. (_Difficulty: Moderately low, Effort:__Moderate)_
  2. <a href="http://www.healthdata.gov/" target="_blank">HealthData.gov</a> has a ton of data from various sources about public health, medicines, etc. Some of this data is super useful for projects/analysis and some of it is just data dumps. Create an R package that downloads data from healthdata.gov and gives some measures of how useful/interesting it is for projects (e.g. number of samples in the study, number of variables measured, is it summary data or raw data, etc.) (_Difficulty: Moderately hard, Effort: High_)
  3. Build an up-to-date aggregator of R tutorials/how-to videos, summarize/rate each one so that people know which ones to look at for learning which tasks. (_Difficulty: Low, Effort: Medium)_

**Tool building**

  1. Build software that creates a 2-d author list and averages people&#8217;s 2-d author lists. (_Difficulty: Medium, Effort: Low)_
  2. Create an R package that interacts with and downloads data from <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/15182715327/list-of-cities-states-with-open-data-help-me-find" target="_blank">government websites</a> and processes it in a way that is easy to analyze. _(Difficulty: Medium, Effort: High)_
