There has been a lot of discussion lately about whether to be in academia or industry. Some of it I think is a bit <a href="http://cs.unm.edu/~terran/academic_blog/?p=113" target="_blank">unfair to academia</a>. Then I saw <a href="http://www.quora.com/Data-Science/Why-is-Hilary-Mason-a-prominent-figure-within-the-big-data-community-What-are-her-notable-accomplishments" target="_blank">this post </a>on Quora asking what Hilary Mason&#8217;s contributions were to machine learning, like she hadn&#8217;t done anything. It struck me as a bit of academia hating on industry*. I don&#8217;t see why one has to be better/worse than the other, as Roger <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/28335633068/why-im-staying-in-academia" target="_blank">points out</a>, there is no perfect job and it just depends on what you want to do. 

One thing that I think gets lost in all of this are the similarities between being an academic researcher and running a small startup. To be a successful professor at a research institution, you have to create a product (papers/software), network (sit on editorial boards/review panels), raise funds (by writing grants), advertise (by giving talks/presentations), identify and recruit talent (students and postdocs), manage people and personalities (students,postdocs, collaborators) and scale (you start as just yourself, and eventually grow to a <a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank">group</a> with <a href="http://www.smart-stats.org/" target="_blank">lots of people</a>). 

The goals are somewhat different. In a startup company, your goal is ultimately to become a profitable business. In academia, the goal is to create an enterprise that produces scientific knowledge. But in either enterprise it takes a huge amount of entrepreneurial spirit, passion, and hustle. It just depends on how you are spending your hustle. 

_*Sidenote: One reason I think she is so famous is that she helps people, even people that can&#8217;t necessarily do anything for her. One time I wrote her out of the blue to see if we could get some Bitly data to analyze for a class. She cheerfully helped us get it, even though the immediate payout for her was not obvious. But I tell you what, when people ask me about her, I&#8217;ll tell them she is awesome. _
