Obviously, there are tons of sessions everyday at <a href="http://amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2012/index.cfm" target="_blank">JSM</a> this week and it&#8217;s physically impossible to go to everything that looks interesting. Alas, I am but one man, so choices had to be made. Here&#8217;s what looks good to me from the <a href="http://amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2012/onlineprogram/" target="_blank">JSM program</a>:

  * 8:30-10:20am: **Contemporary Software Design Strategies for Statistical Methodologists**, HQ-Sapphire B
  * 10:30am-12:20pm: **Stat-Us Update from Facebook**, HQ-Sapphire EF
  * 2:00-3:50pm: **Astrostatistics**, CC-Room 29A or **Results from the 2010 Census Experimental Program**, CC-Room 30A (perhaps you can run back and forth?)

Lots of other good stuff out there, of course. I wouldn&#8217;t mind hearing some feedback on how these go.
