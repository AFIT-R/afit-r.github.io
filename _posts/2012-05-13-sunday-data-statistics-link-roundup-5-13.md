  1. Patenting <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/jobs/an-actuary-proves-patents-arent-only-for-engineers.html?_r=1" target="_blank">statistical sampling</a>? I&#8217;m pretty sure the Supreme Court who threw out the Mayo Patent wouldn&#8217;t have much trouble tossing this patent either. The properties of sampling are a &#8220;law of nature&#8221; right? via Leonid K. 
  2. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUaInS6HIGo" target="_blank">This video</a> has me all fired up, its called 23&#160;1/2 hours and talks about how the best preventative health measure is getting 30 minutes of exercise - just walking - every day. He shows how in some cases this beats doing much more high-tech interventions. My favorite part of this video is how he uses a ton of statistical/epidemiological terms like &#8220;effect sizes&#8221;, &#8220;meta-analysis&#8221;, &#8220;longitudinal study&#8221;, &#8220;attributable fractions&#8221;, but makes them understandable to a broad audience. This is a great example of &#8220;statistics for good&#8221;.
  3. A very nice collection of <a href="http://www.twotorials.com/2012/05/ninety-two-minute-r-tutorial-videos.html" target="_blank">2-minute tutorials</a> in R. This is a great way to teach the concepts, most of which don&#8217;t need more than 2 minutes, and it covers a lot of ground. One thing that drives me crazy is when I go into Rafa&#8217;s office with a hairy computational problem and he says, &#8220;Oh you didn&#8217;t know about function x?&#8221;. Of course this only happens after I&#8217;ve wasted an hour re-inventing the wheel. If more people put up 2 minute tutorials on all the cool tricks they know, the better we&#8217;d all be. 
  4. A plot using ggplot2, developed by this week&#8217;s interviewee <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/22844703875/ha" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham</a> appears <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/03/the-foreign-language-of-mad-men/254668/" target="_blank">in the Atlantic</a>! Via David S. 
  5. I&#8217;m refusing to buy into Apple&#8217;s hegemony, so I&#8217;m still running OS 10.5. I&#8217;m having trouble getting github up and running. Anyone have this same problem/know a solution? I know, I know, I&#8217;m way behind the times on this&#8230;
