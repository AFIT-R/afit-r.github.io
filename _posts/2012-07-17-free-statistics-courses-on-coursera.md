    **Instructor**: <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~jleek/" target="_blank">Jeff Leek</a>
  * **<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata" target="_blank">Computing for Data Analysis</a>**: This course is about learning the fundamental computing skills necessary for effective data analysis. You will learn to program in R and to use R for reading data, writing functions, making informative graphs, and applying modern statistical methods.  
    **Instructor**: <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/" target="_blank">Roger Peng</a>
  * **<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/biostats" target="_blank">Mathematical Biostatistics Bootcamp</a>**: This course presents fundamental probability and statistical concepts used in biostatistical data analysis. It is taught at an introductory level for students with junior- or senior-college level mathematical training.
