Jeff and I had a chance to interview [Michael Eisen](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/), a co-founder of the [Public Library of Science](http://plos.org), HHMI Investigator,Â and a Professor at UC Berkeley. We talked with him about publishing in open access and how young investigators might publish in open access journals under the current system. Watch part 1 of the interview above.
