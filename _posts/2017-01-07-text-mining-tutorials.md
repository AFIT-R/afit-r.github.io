title: New Tutorials for Text Mining
---

Analysts are often trained to handle tabular or rectangular data that are mostly numeric, but much of the data proliferating today is unstructured and typically text-heavy. Many of us who work in analytic fields are not trained in even simple interpretation of natural language.  Fortunately, many of the principles used to organize, analyze, and visualize tabular data can be applied to unstructured text to extract meaning from this information.

Check out the first couple [text mining tutorials](http://afit-r.github.io/descriptive) that have been released.  Additional tutorials will be released in the coming weeks.
