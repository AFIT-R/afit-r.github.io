  1. [A randomized controlled trial](http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/11/airport-security.aspx) shows that using conversation to detect suspicious behavior is much more effective then just monitoring body language (via Ann L. on Twitter). This comes as a crushing blow to those of us who enjoyed the now-cancelled [Lie to Me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_to_Me) and assumed it was all real.
  2. Check out this awesome [real-time visualization](http://map.ipviking.com/) of different types of network attacks. Rafa says if you watch long enough you will almost certainly observe a "storm" of attacks. A cool student project would be modeling the distribution of these attacks if you could collect the data (via David S.).
  3. [Consider this: Did Big Data Kill the Statistician?](http://goodstrat.com/2014/12/03/consider-this-did-big-data-kill-the-statistician/) I understand the sentiment, that statistical thinking and applied statistics has been around a long time and has [produced some good ideas](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/22/10-things-statistics-taught-us-about-big-data-analysis/). On the other hand, there is definitely a large group of statisticians who aren't willing to expand their thinking beyond a really narrow set of ideas (via Rafa)
