This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/business/after-moneyball-data-guys-are-triumphant.html" target="_blank">article following up on the Moneyball PR</a> demonstrates one of the reasons why statistics might be doomed:

> Julia Rozovsky is a Yale M.B.A. student who studied economics and math as an undergraduate, a background that prepared her for a traditional — and lucrative — consulting career. Instead, partly as a result of reading “Moneyball” and finding like-minded people, she pointed herself toward work in analytics.

Why can&#8217;t they call it statistics?? The message, of course, is statistics is boring. Analytics is awesome. We probably need to start changing the names of our departments.
