  1. The psychologist whose experiment didn&#8217;t replicate then <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/19190862781/sunday-data-statistics-link-roundup-3-11" target="_blank">went off</a> on the scientists who did the replication experiment is <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-natural-unconscious/201203/angry-birds?page=2" target="_blank">at it again</a>. I don&#8217;t see a clear argument about the facts of the matter in his post, just more name calling. This seems to be a case study in what not to do when your study doesn&#8217;t replicate. More on &#8220;conceptual replication&#8221; in there too. 
  2. Berkeley is running a <a href="http://datascienc.es/" target="_blank">data science course</a> with instructors <span>Jeff Hammerbacher and Mike Franklin, I looked through the notes and it looks pretty amazing. Stay tuned for more info about my applied statistics class which starts this week. </span>
  3. <span>A <a href="http://nyti.ms/GXwvUe." target="_blank">cool article</a> about Factual, one of the companies whose sole mission in life is to collect and distribute data. We&#8217;ve <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/10410458080/data-sources" target="_blank">linked</a> to them before. We are so out ahead of the Times on this one&#8230;</span>
  4. <span>This isn&#8217;t statistics related, but I love <a href="http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-03-20/tech/31212683_1_jeff-bezos-robot-bookstore" target="_blank">this post</a> about Jeff Bezos. If we all indulged our inner 11 year old a little more, it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad thing. </span>
  5. <span>If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to read Reeves <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/19646774024/laws-of-nature-and-the-law-of-patents-supreme-court" target="_blank">guest post</a> on the Mayo Supreme Court decision yet, you should, it is really interesting. A fascinating intersection of law and statistics is going on in the personalized medicine world right now. </span>
