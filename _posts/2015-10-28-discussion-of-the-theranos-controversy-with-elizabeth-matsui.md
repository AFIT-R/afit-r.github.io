Theranos is a Silicon Valley diagnostic testing company that has been in the news recently. The story of Theranos has fascinated me because I think it represents a perfect collision of the tech startup culture and the health care culture and how combining them together can generate unique problems.

I talked with Elizabeth Matsui, a Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Allergy and Immunology here at Johns Hopkins, to discuss Theranos, the realities of diagnostic testing, and the unique challenges that a health-tech startup faces with respect to doing good science and building products people want to buy.
