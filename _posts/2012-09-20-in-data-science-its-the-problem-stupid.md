I just saw <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v30/n8/full/nbt.2301.html" target="_blank">this article </a>talking about how in the biotech world, you can&#8217;t get caught chasing the latest technology. You have to start with a problem you are solving for people and then work your way back. This reminds me a lot of <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/26068033590/motivating-statistical-projects" target="_blank">Type B problems</a> in data science/statistics. <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory" target="_blank">We have a pile of data, so we don&#8217;t need to have a problem to solve, it will come to us later</a>. I think the answer to the question, &#8220;Did you start with a scientific/business problem that needs solving regardless of whether the data was in place?&#8221; will end up being a near perfect classifier for separating the &#8220;Big Data&#8221; projects that are just hype from the ones that will pan out long term.Â
