So I'm a day late, but you know, I got a new kid and stuff...

  1. [The New Yorker hating on MOOCs](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/moocs-failure-solutions), they mention all the usual stuff. Including the [really poorly designed San Jose State experiment](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/07/19/the-failure-of-moocs-and-the-ecological-fallacy/). I think this deserves a longer post, but this is definitely a case where people are looking at MOOCs on the [wrong part of the hype curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle). MOOCs won't solve all possible education problems, but they are hugely helpful to many people and writing them off is a little silly (via Rafa).
  2. My colleague Dan S. is [teaching a missing data workshop](http://www.eventzilla.net/web/event?eventid=2139054537) here at Hopkins next week (via Dan S.)
  3. A couple of cool Youtube videos explaining [how the normal distribution sounds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmOsDTczOFs) and the [pareto principle with paperclips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-I-BVqMiNI) (via Presh T., pair with the [80/20 rule of statistical methods development](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/03/20/the-8020-rule-of-statistical-methods-development/))
  4. If you aren't following [Research Wahlberg](https://twitter.com/ResearchMark), you aren't on academic twitter.
  5. I followed  [#biodata14](https://twitter.com/hashtag/biodata14?src=hash)  closely. I think having a meeting on Biological Big Data is a great idea and many of the discussion leaders are people I admire a ton. I also am a big fan of Mike S. I have to say I was pretty bummed that more statisticians weren't invited (we like to party too!).
  6. Our data science specialization generates [almost 1,000 new R github repos a month](http://rpubs.com/hadley/39122)! Roger and I are in a neck and neck race to be the person who has taught the most people statistics/data science in the history of the world.
  7. The Rstudio guys have also put together what looks like a [great course](http://blog.rstudio.org/2014/11/06/introduction-to-data-science-with-r-video-workshop/) similar in spirit to our Data Science Specialization. The Rstudio folks have been \*super\* supportive of the DSS and we assume anything they make will be awesome.
  8. [Congrats to Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.github.io/blog/2014/11/05/announce/) and [So I'm a day late, but you know, I got a new kid and stuff...
