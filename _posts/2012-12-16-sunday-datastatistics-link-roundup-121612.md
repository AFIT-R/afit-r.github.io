  1. A [directory of open access journals](http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=home&uiLanguage=en). Very cool idea to aggregate them. Here is a [blog postÂ ](http://www.thejuliagroup.com/blog/?p=2898)from one of my favorite statistics bloggers about why open-access journals are so cool. Just like in a lot of other areas, open access journals can be thought of as an open data initiative.
  2. Here is a website that [displays data on the relative wealth of neighborhoods](http://www.richblockspoorblocks.com/), broken down by census track. It's pretty fascinating to take a look and see what the income changes are, even in regions pretty close to each other.
  3. More citizen science goodness. Zooniverse [has a new project](https://www.zooniverse.org/project/snapshotserengeti) where you can look through a bunch of pictures in the Serengeti and see if you can find animals.
  4. Nate Silver [talking about his new book](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mYIgSq-ZWE0) with Hal Varian. ([via](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mYIgSq-ZWE0)). I have skimmed the book and found that the parts about baseball/politics are awesome and the other parts seem a little light. But maybe that's just my pre-conceived bias? I'd love to hear what other people thought...
