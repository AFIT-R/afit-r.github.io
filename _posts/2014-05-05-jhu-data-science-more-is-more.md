Today Jeff Leek, Brian Caffo, and I are launching 3 new courses on Coursera as part of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1). These courses are

  * [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/exdata)
  * [Reproducible Research](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata)
  * [Statistical Inference](https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference)

I'm particularly excited about Reproducible Research, not just because I'm teaching it, but because I think it's essentially the first of its kind being offered in a massive open format. Given the rich discussions about reproducibility that have occurred over the past few years, I'm happy to finally be able to offer this course for free to a large audience.

<span style="font-size: 16px;">These courses are launching inÂ </span>addition to the first 3 courses in the sequence: [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/course/datascitoolbox), [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog), and [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata), which are also running this month in case you missed your chance in April.

All told we have 6 of the 9 courses in the Specialization available as of today. We're really looking forward to next month where we will be launching the final 3 courses: [Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/regmods), [Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn), and [Developing Data Products](https://www.coursera.org/course/predmachlearn). We also have some exciting announcements coming soon regarding the Capstone Projects.

Every course will be available every month, so don't worry about missing a session. You can always come back next month.
