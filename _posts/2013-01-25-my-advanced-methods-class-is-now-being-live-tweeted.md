A student in my class is going to be live-tweeting my (often silly/controversial) comments in the advanced/Ph.D. data analysis and methods class I'm teaching here at Hopkins. The hashtag is #jhsph753 and the class runs from 10:30am to 12:00PM EST. Check it out [here](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23jhsph753&src=hash).
