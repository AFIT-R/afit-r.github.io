The U.S. Supreme Court just made a unanimous ruling in [Riley v. California](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/document-preview.aspx?doc_id=171429294) making it clear that police officers must get a warrant before searching through the contents of a cell phone obtained incident to an arrest. The message was put pretty clearly in the decision:

>  Our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple — get a warrant.

But I was more fascinated by this quote:

> The sum of an individual’s private life can be reconstructed through a thousand photographs labeled with dates, locations, and descriptions; the same cannot be said of a photograph or two of loved ones tucked into a wallet.

So n = 2 is not enough to recreate a private life, but n = 2,000 (with associated annotation) is enough.  I wonder what the minimum sample size needed is to officially violate someone's privacy. I'd be curious get [Cathy O'Neil](http://mathbabe.org/)'s opinion on that question, she seems to have thought very hard about the relationship between data and privacy.

This is another case where I think that, to some extent, the Supreme Court made a decision [on the basis of a statistical concept](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/12/12/the-supreme-courts-interpretation-of-statistical/). Last time it was correlation, this time it is inference. As I read the opinion, part of the argument hinged on how much information do you get by searching a cell phone versus a wallet? Importantly, how much can you infer from those two sets of data?

If any of the Supreme's want a primer in statistics, I'm available.
