After reposting on the comparison between the lasso and the always top 10 predictor (leekasso) I got some feedback that the problem could be I wasn't debiasing the Lasso (thanks Tim T. on Twitter!). The idea behind debiasing (as I understand it) is to use the Lasso to do feature selection and then fit model without shrinkage to "debias" the coefficients. The debiased model is then used for prediction. [Noah Simon](http://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/), who knows approximately infinitely more about this than I do, kindly provided some code for fitting a debiased Lasso. He is not responsible for any mistakes/silliness in the simulation, he was just nice enough to provide some debiased Lasso code. He mentions a similar idea appears in the [relaxo package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/relaxo/relaxo.pdf) if you set <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_0b92f8c2972983f15725fd66e4a72066.gif' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; ' class='tex' alt="\phi=0" /></span>.

I used the [same simulation set up ](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/01/04/repost-prediction-the-lasso-vs-just-using-the-top-10-predictors/)as before and tried out the Leekasso, the Lasso and the Debiased Lasso. Here are the accuracy results (more red = higher accuracy):

  The results suggest the debiased Lasso still doesn't work well under this design. Keep in mind as I mentioned in my previous post that the Lasso may perform better under a different causal model.
