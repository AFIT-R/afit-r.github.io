My colleagues and I just published a paper <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/150/abstract" target="_blank">on validation of genomic results</a> in BMC Bioinformatics. It is <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/mostviewed" target="_blank">&#8220;highly accessed&#8221;</a> and we are really happy with how it turned out. 

But it was brutal getting it published. Here is the line-up of places I sent the paper. 

  * **Science**: Submitted 10/6/10, rejected 10/18/10 without review. I know this seems like a long shot, but this <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1230" target="_blank">paper on validation</a> was published in Science not too long after. 
  * **Nature Methods**: Submitted 10/20/10, rejected 10/28/10 without review. Not much to say here, moving on&#8230;
  * **Genome Biology**: Submitted 11/1/10, rejected 1/5/11. 2/3 referees thought the paper was interesting, few specific concerns raised. I felt they could be addressed so appealed on 1/10/11, appeal accepted 1/20/11, paper resubmitted 1/21/11. Paper rejected 2/25/11. 2/3 referees were happy with the revisions. One still didn&#8217;t like it. 
  * **Bioinformatics**: Submitted 3/3/11, rejected 3/1311 without review. I appealed again, it turns out &#8220;I have checked with the editors about this for you and t<span>heir opinion was that there was already substantial work in </span><span class="il">validating</span><span> gene lists based on random sampling.&#8221; If anyone knows about one of those papers let me know :-). </span>
  * <span><strong>Nucleic Acids Research</strong>: Submitted 3/18/11, rejected with invitation for revision 3/22/11. Resubmitted 12/15/11 (got delayed by a few projects here) rejected 1/25/12. Reason for rejection seemed to be one referee had major &#8220;philosophical issues&#8221; with the paper.<br /></span>
  * <span><strong>BMC Bioinformatics</strong>: Submitted 1/31/12, first review 3/23/12, resubmitted 4/27/12, second revision requested 5/23/12, revised version submitted 5/25/12, accepted 6/14/12. <br /></span>

  An interesting side note is the really brief reviews from the Genome Biology submission inspired me to <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0026895" target="_blank">do this paper</a>. I had time to conceive the study, get IRB approval, build a web game for peer review, recruit subjects, collect the data, analyze the data, write the paper, submit the paper to 3 journals and have it come out 6 months before the paper that inspired it was published!

  Ok, glad I got that off my chest.
