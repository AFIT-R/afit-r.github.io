  1. [An interesting post](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/07/01/science_majors_are_hard_that_s_why_people_don_t_do_them.html) about how lots of people start out in STEM majors but eventually bail because they are too hard. They recommend either: (1) we better prepare high school students or (2) we make STEM majors easier. I like the idea of making STEM majors more interactive and self-paced. There is a bigger issue here of weed-out classes and barrier classes that deserves a longer discussion (via Alex N.)
  2. This is [an incredibly interesting FDA proposal](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-06-04/html/2013-13083.htm) to share all clinical data. I didn't know this, but apparently right now all FDA data is proprietary. That is stunning to me, given the openness that we have say in genomic data - where most data are public. This goes beyond even the alltrials idea of reporting all results. I think we need full open disclosure of data and need to think hard about the privacy/consent implications this may have (via Rima I.).
  3. This is a [pretty cool data science](http://insightdatascience.com/) fellowship program for people who want to transition from academia to industry, post PhD. I have no idea if the program is any good, but certainly the concept is a great one. (via Sherri R.)
  4. [A paper in Nature Methods](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v10/n7/full/nmeth.2530.html?utm_content=buffercf9e7&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer) about data visualization and understanding the levels of uncertainty in data analysis. I love seeing that journals are recognizing the importance of uncertainty in analysis. Sometimes I feel like the "biggies" want perfect answers with no uncertainty - which never happens.

That's it, just a short set of links today. Enjoy your 4th!
