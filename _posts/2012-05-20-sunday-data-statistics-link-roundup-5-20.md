  It&#8217;s grant season around here so I&#8217;ll be brief:
</div>

  1. I love <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303448404577410341236847980.html" target="_blank">this article</a> in the WSJ about the crisis at JP Morgan. The key point it highlights is that looking only at the high-level analysis and summaries can be misleading, you have to look at the raw data to see the potential problems. As data become more complex, I think its critical we stay in touch with the raw data, regardless of discipline. At least if I miss something in the raw data I don&#8217;t lose a couple billion. Spotted by Leonid K. 
  2. On the other hand, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/science/a-mathematical-challenge-to-obesity.html?_r=1" target="_blank">this article</a> in the Times drives me a little bonkers. It makes it sound like there is one mathematical model that will solve the obesity epidemic. Lines like this are ridiculous: &#8220;<span>Because to do this experimentally would take years. You could find out much more quickly if you did the math.&#8221; The obesity epidemic is due to a complex interplay of cultural, sociological, economic, and policy factors. The idea you could &#8220;figure it out&#8221; with a set of simple equations is laughable. If you check out <a href="http://bwsimulator.niddk.nih.gov/" target="_blank">their model</a> this is clearly not the answer to the obesity epidemic. Just another example of why <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/20902656344/statistics-is-not-math" target="_blank">statistics is not math</a>. If you don&#8217;t want to hopelessly oversimplify the problem, you need careful data collection, analysis, and interpretation. For a broader look at this problem, check out this article on <a href="http://www.american.com/archive/2012/may/science-vs-pr" target="_blank">Science vs. PR</a>. Via Andrew J. </span>
  3. <span>Some <a href="http://freakonometrics.blog.free.fr/index.php?post/2012/04/18/foundwaldo" target="_blank">cool applications</a> of the raster package in R. This kind of thing is fun for student projects because analyzing images leads to results that are easy to interpret/visualize.</span>
  4. <span>Check out John C.&#8217;s <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/05/07/how-do-you-know-when-someone-is-great/" target="_blank">really fascinating post</a> on determining when a white-collar worker is great. Inspired by <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/22585430491/how-do-you-know-if-someone-is-great-at-data-analysis" target="_blank">Roger&#8217;s post</a> on knowing when someone is good at data analysis. </span>
