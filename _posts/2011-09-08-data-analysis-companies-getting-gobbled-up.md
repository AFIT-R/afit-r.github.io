Companies that specialize in data analysis, or essentially, statistics, are getting gobbled up by larger companies. IBM bought <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/ibm-to-pay-12-billion-for-software-maker/" target="_blank">SPSS</a>, then later <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/01/ibm-to-buy-algorithmics-for-387-million/" target="_blank">Algorithmics</a>. MSCI bought <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/03/01/msci-buys-riskmetrics-for-1-55-billion/" target="_blank">RiskMetrics</a>. HP bought <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/after-h-p-s-rich-offer-deal-making-spotlight-swings-to-data-analysis/" target="_blank">Autonomy</a>. Who&#8217;s next? SAS?
