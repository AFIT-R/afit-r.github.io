Amanda Palmer broke Twitter yesterday <a href="http://www.amandapalmer.net/blog/20121015/" target="_blank">with her insurance poll</a>. She started off just talking about how hard it is for musicians who rarely have health insurance, but then wandered into polling territory. She sent out a request for people to respond with the following information:

> _quick twitter poll. 1) COUNTRY?! 2) profession? 3) insured? 4) if not, why not, if so, at what cost per month (or covered by job)?_

This quick little poll struck a nerve with people and her Twitter feed blew up. Long story short, tons of interesting information was gathered from folks. This information is frequently kept semi-obscured, particularly what is the cost of health insurance for folks in different places. This isn&#8217;t the sort of info that insurance companies necessarily publicize widely and isn&#8217;t the sort of thing people talk about. 

The results were really fascinating and its worth reading the above blog post or checking out the hashtag: <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23insurancepoll&src=typd" target="_blank">#insurancepoll</a>. But the most fascinating thing for me as a statistician was thinking about how to analyze these data. <a href="https://twitter.com/aubreyjaubrey" target="_blank">@<span>aubreyjaubrey</span></a> is apparently collecting the data someplace, hopefully she&#8217;ll make it public. 

At least two key issues spring to mind:

  1. This is a massive convenience sample. 
  2. It is being collected through a social network

Although I&#8217;m sure there are more. If a student is looking for an amazingly interesting/rich data set and some seriously hard stats problems, they should get in touch with Aubrey and see if they can make something of it!
