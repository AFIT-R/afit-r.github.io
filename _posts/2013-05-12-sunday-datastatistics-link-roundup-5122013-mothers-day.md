  1. <span style="line-height: 16px;">A tutorial on <a href="http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/">deep-learning</a>, I really enjoyed reading it, but I'm still trying to figure out how this is different than non-linear logistic regression to estimate features then supervised prediction using those features? Or maybe I'm just naive....</span>
  2. Rafa on [political autonomy for science](http://www.80grados.net/la-importancia-de-la-autonomia-politica-para-las-ciencias/) for a blog in PR called [80 grados. ](http://www.80grados.net/) He writes about Rep. Lamar Smith and then focuses more closely on issues related to the University of Puerto Rico. A very nice read. (via Rafa)
  3. [Highest paid employees by state](http://deadspin.com/infographic-is-your-states-highest-paid-employee-a-co-489635228). I should have coached football...
  4. [Newton took the mean.](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/05/groundbreaking-isaac-newton-invention-youve-never-heard) It warms my empirical heart to hear about how the theoretical result was backed up by averaging (via David S.)
  5. Reinhart and Rogoff [publish a correction but stand by their original claims](http://www.cnbc.com/id/100721630). I'm not sure whether this is a good or a bad thing. But it definitely is an overall win for reproducibility.
  6. Statesy folks are getting some much-deserved attention. Terry Speed is a [Fellow of the Royal Society](http://royalsociety.org/people/terence-speed/), Peter Hall is a [foreign associate of the NAS](http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2013_04_30_NAS_Election.html), Gareth Roberts is [also a Fellow of the Royal Society](http://royalsociety.org/people/gareth-roberts/) (via Peter H.)
  7. [Statisticians go to the movies ](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/business/media/solving-equation-of-a-hit-film-script-with-data.html?src=rechp&_r=1&)and [the hot hand analysis makes the NY Times](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/are-hot-hands-in-sports-for-real/) (via Dan S.)

**Bonus Link! ** Karl B.'s Github [tutorial is awesome](http://www.statsblogs.com/2013/05/10/tutorials-on-gitgithub-and-gnu-make/) and every statistician should be required to read it. I only ask why he gives all the love to Nacho's admittedly awesome [Clickme package](https://github.com/nachocab/clickme) and no love to [healthvis](http://healthvis.org/), we are on [Github too](https://github.com/hcorrada/healthvis)!
