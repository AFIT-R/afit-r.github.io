I don&#8217;t mean to brag, but I was an early Apple Fanboy - not sure that is something to brag about now that I write it down. I convinced my advisor to go to all Macs in our lab in 2004. Since then I have been pretty dedicated to the brand, dutifully shelling out almost 2g&#8217;s every time I need a new laptop. I love the way Macs just work (until they don&#8217;t and you need a new laptop).

But I hate the way Apple seems to be dedicated to bleeding <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/13412260027/apple-this-is-ridiculous-you-gotta-upgrade-to" target="_blank">every last cent</a> out of me. So I saved up my Christmas gift money (thanks Grandmas!) and bought a <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chromebook/" target="_blank">Chromebook</a>. It cost me $350 and I was at least in part inspired by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DazdIFMbC_4" target="_blank">these</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0ISVHdzJsQ" target="_blank">clever</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaI9hORJS4M" target="_blank">ads</a>.

So far I&#8217;m super pumped about the performance of the Chromebook. Things I love:

  1. About 10 seconds to boot from shutdown, instantly awake from sleep
  2. Super long battery life - 8 hours a charge might be an underestimate
  3. Size - its a 12 inch laptop and just right for sitting on my lap and typing
  4. Since everything is cloud based, nothing to install/optimize

It took me a while to get used to the Browser being the operating system. When I close the last browser window, I expect to see the Desktop. Instead, a new browser window pops up. But that discomfort only lasted a short time.

It turns out I can do pretty much everything I do on my Macbook on the Chromebook. I can access our department&#8217;s computing cluster by turning on developer mode and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/chromebook-central/dZDs1GFdlzY" target="_blank">opening a shell</a>(thanks <a href="http://www.bcaffo.com/" target="_blank">Caffo</a>!). I can do all my word processing on google docs. Email is just gmail as usual. <a href="http://www.scribtex.com/" target="_blank">Scribtex</a> for latex (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/pecase2010/BrianCaffo.jpg" target="_blank">Caffo</a> again). <a href="https://music.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Music</a> is so awesome I wish I had started my account before I got my Chromebook. The only thing I&#8217;m really trying to settle on is a cloud-based code editor with syntax highlighting. I&#8217;m open to suggestions (Caffo?).

I&#8217;m starting to think I could bail on Apple&#8230;.
