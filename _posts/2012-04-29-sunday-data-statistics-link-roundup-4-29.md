  1. Nature genetics has <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n5/full/ng.2264.html" target="_blank">an editorial</a> on the Mayo and Myriad cases. I agree with this bit: &#8220;<span>In our opinion, it is not new judgments or legislation that are needed but more innovation. In the era of whole-genome sequencing of highly variable genomes, it is increasingly hard to justify exclusive ownership of particularly useful parts of the genome, and method claims must be more carefully described.&#8221; Via <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ajaffe/" target="_blank">Andrew J.</a></span>
  2. One of Tech Review&#8217;s 10 emerging technologies from a February 2003 article? <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/InfoTech/12256/" target="_blank">Data mining</a>. I think doing interesting things with data has probably always been a hot topic, it just gets press in cycles. Via Aleks J. 
  3. An infographic in the New York Times compares the profits and taxes of Apple <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2012/04/29/technology/29appletax-hp-graphic.html?ref=business" target="_blank">over time</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html?_r=1&hp" target="_blank">here is an explanation</a> of how they do it. (Via Tim O.)
  4. Saw <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fivethirtyeight/status/192683954510364672" target="_blank">this tweet</a> via Joe B. I&#8217;m not sure if the frequentists or the Bayesians are winning, but it seems to me that the battle no longer matters to my generation of statisticians - there are too many data sets to analyze, better to just use what works!
  5. Statistical and computational algorithms that <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/04/can-an-algorithm-write-a-better-news-story-than-a-human-reporter/" target="_blank">write news stories</a>. Simply Statistics remains 100% human written (for now). 
  6. The <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/12076163379/the-5-most-critical-statistical-concepts" target="_blank">5 most critical</a> statistical concepts.
