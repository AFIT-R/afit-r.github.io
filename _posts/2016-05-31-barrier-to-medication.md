There's definitely a need to innovate and develop new treatments in
the area of asthma, but it's easy to underestimate the barriers to
just doing what we already know, such as making sure that people are
following existing, well-established guidelines on how to treat
asthma. My colleague, Elizabeth Matsui, has [written about the
challenges](http://skybrudeconsulting.com/blog/2016/05/31/barriers-medication.html) in a [study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02251379?term=ecatch&rank=1) that we are collaborating on:

> Our group is currently conducting a study that includes implementation of national guidelines-based medical care for asthma, so that one process that we’ve had to get right is to **prescribe an appropriate dose of medication and get it into the family’s hands**. [emphasis added]

Seems simple, right?
