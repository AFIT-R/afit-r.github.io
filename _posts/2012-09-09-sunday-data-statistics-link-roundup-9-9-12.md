  1. Not necessarily statistics related, but pretty appropriate now that the school year is starting. Here is a little introduction to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ikDIW.gif" target="_blank">&#8220;how to google&#8221;</a> (via Andrew J.). Being able to &#8220;just google it&#8221; and find answers for oneself without having to resort to asking folks is maybe the #1 most useful skill as a statistician. 
  2. A <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7586336/RSS2012/googleVis_at_RSS_2012.html#(1)" target="_blank">really nice presentation</a> on interactive graphics with the googleVis package. I think one of the most interesting things about the presentation is that it was built with markdown/knitr/slidy (see slide 53). I am seeing more and more of these web-based presentations. I like them for a lot of reasons (ability to incorporate interactive graphics, easy sharing, etc.), although it is still harder than building a Powerpoint. I also wonder, what happens when you are trying to present somewhere that doesn&#8217;t have a good internet connection?
  3. We talked a lot about the ENCODE project this week. We had an <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/31056769228/interview-with-steven-salzberg-about-the-encode" target="_blank">interview with Steven Salzberg</a>, then Rafa followed it up with a discussion of <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/31067828460/top-down-versus-bottom-up-science-data-analysis" target="_blank">top-down vs. bottom-up science</a>. Tons of data from the ENCODE project is <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/" target="_blank">now available</a>, there is even a <a href="http://scofield.bx.psu.edu/~dannon/encodevm/" target="_blank">virtual machine</a> with all the software used in the main analysis of the data that was just published. But my favorite quote/tweet/comment this week came from Leonid K. about a flawed/over the top piece trying to make a little too much of the ENCODE discoveries: &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/leonidkruglyak/status/244425345481183232" target="_blank">that&#8217;s a clown post, bro</a>&#8221;.
  4. Another breathless post from the Chronicle about how there are &#8220;<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/Dozens-of-Plagiarism-Incidents/133697/" target="_blank">dozens of plagiarism cases being reported on Coursera</a>&#8221;. Given that tens of thousands of people are taking the course, it would be shocking if there wasn&#8217;t plagiarism, but my guess is it is about the same rate you see in in-person classes. I will be using peer grading in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/dataanalysis" target="_blank">my course</a>, hopefully plagiarism software will be in place by then. 
  5. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/science/visual-strategies-transforms-data-into-art-that-speaks.html?_r=2&ref=science" target="_blank">New York Times article</a> about a new book on visualizing data for scientists/engineers. I love all the attention data visualization is getting. I&#8217;ll take a look at the book for sure. I bet it says a lot of the same things Tufte said and a lot of the things Nathan Yau <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470944889/?tag=flowingdata-20" target="_blank">says in his book.</a> This one may just be targeted at scientists/engineers.

  6. Edo and co. are putting together <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/social2012/" target="_blank">a workshop on the analysis of social network data for NIPS</a> in December. If you do this kind of stuff, it should be a pretty awesome crowd, so get your paper in by the Oct. 15th deadline!
