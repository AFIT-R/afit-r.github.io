I just saw a pretty wild statistic on Twitter that less than 60% of university news releases link to the papers they are describing.

Before you believe anything your read about science in the news, you need to go and find the original article.  When the article isn't linked in the press release, sometimes you need to do a bit of sleuthing.  Here is an example of how I do it for a news article. In general the press-release approach is very similar, but you skip the first step I describe below.

**Here is the news article ([link](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/14/online-avatar-personality_n_6463484.html?utm_hp_ref=science)):**

&nbsp;

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3787" src="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-1.11.22-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 1.11.22 PM" width="300" height="405" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1: Look for a link to the article**

Usually it will be linked near the top or the bottom of the article. In this case, the article links to the press release about the paper. _This is not the original research article_. If you don't get to a scientific journal you aren't finished. In this case, the press release actually gives the full title of the article, but that will happen less than 60% of the time according to the statistic above.

&nbsp;

**Step 2: Look for names of the authors, scientific key words and journal name if available**

You are going to use these terms to search in a minute. In this case the only two things we have are the journal name:
  
[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3791" src="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-2.png" alt="Untitled presentation (2)" width="949" height="334" srcset="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-2-300x105.png 300w, http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-2-260x91.png 260w, http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-2.png 949w" sizes="(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px" />](http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-2.png)

&nbsp;

And some key words:

&nbsp;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3792" src="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-3.png" alt="Untitled presentation (3)" width="933" height="343" srcset="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-3-300x110.png 300w, http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-3.png 933w" sizes="(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px" />](http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-3.png)

&nbsp;

**Step 3 Use Google Scholar**

You could just google those words and sometimes you get the real paper, but often you just end up back at the press release/news article. So instead the best way to find the article is to go to [Google Scholar ](https://scholar.google.com/)then click on the little triangle next to the search box.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3793" src="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-4.png" alt="Untitled presentation (4)" width="960" height="540" srcset="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-4-260x146.png 260w, http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-4.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />](http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Untitled-presentation-4.png)

Fill in information while you can. Fill in the same year as the press release, information about the journal, university and key words.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 4 Victory**

Often this will come up with the article you are looking for:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3795" src="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-1.32.45-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-15 at 1.32.45 PM" width="813" height="658" srcset="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-1.32.45-PM-247x200.png 247w, http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-1.32.45-PM.png 813w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" />](http://simplystatistics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-15-at-1.32.45-PM.png)

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, the article may be paywalled, so if you don't work at a university or institute with a subscription, you can always tweet the article name with the hashtag [I just saw a pretty wild statistic on Twitter that less than 60% of university news releases link to the papers they are describing.

Then you just have to hope that someone will send it to you (they often do).
