title: Updated Intro to R Bootcamp Files!
---

UC BANA students, the [Intro to R Bootcamp](http://uc-r.github.io/r_bootcamp) slides have been updated to reveal the solutions for each *Your Turn!* exercise. Just scroll down to the [Schedule section](http://uc-r.github.io/r_bootcamp#schedule) and click on the <i class="fa fa-file-powerpoint-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon for each session in and you'll see the updated slides.  I also add my code to the script files (<i class="fa fa-file-code-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>) so you can see my approach to many of the topics we covered.  Enjoy!
