Character string data are often considered semi-structured data.  Text can be structured in a specified field; however, the quality and consistency of the text input can be far from structured.  Consequently, managing and manipulating character strings can be extremely tedious and unique to each data wrangling process.  As a result, taking the time to learn the nuances of dealing with character strings and regex functions can provide a great return on investment; however, the functions and techniques required will likey be greater than what I could offer here.  So here are additional resources that are worth reading and learning from:

* [Handling and Processing Strings in R](http://gastonsanchez.com/Handling_and_Processing_Strings_in_R.pdf)
* [`stringr` Package Vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html)
* [Regular Expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)
