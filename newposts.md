To write a new post follow these guidlines. 

1. Update the repo
    * The first time, clone this repo https://github.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io
    * After that do `git pull origin master` to make sure you get all the new posts from others
2. Go to the folder *_posts*
3. Copy the example post: https://github.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2011-09-01-examplepost.md to a new file with the format:  `YYYY-MM-DD-a-relevant-title-separated-by-hyphens.md`
4. Write your post in markdown. 
5. Add, commmit, and push your changes to the repo
6. Tweet about the post/post to Facebook/post to reddit


## Workflow for writing posts if you are a contributor

To write a new post you can either contact Roger/Jeff/Rafa first to ask if you can guest post (preferred) or just
send a pull request (less preferred). 

1. Update the repo: 
    * The first time fork this repo https://github.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io
    * After that do `git pull origin master` to make sure you get all the new posts from others
2. Go to the folder *_posts*
3. Copy the example post: https://github.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2011-09-01-examplepost.md to a new file with the format:  `YYYY-MM-DD-a-relevant-title-separated-by-hyphens.md`
4. Write your post in markdown. 
5. Add a line at the beginning that says: _Editor's note this is a guest post by ..._ with your information. 
5. Add, commmit, and push your changes to your forked branch
6. Send a pull request
7. We will review the pull request and if (a) the pull request can be accepted with no changes and (b) we approve of the post
we will accept the pull request and your post will appear on the blog. 
8. Tweet about the post/post to Facebook/post to reddit
