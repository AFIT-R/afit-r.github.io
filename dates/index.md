Real world data are often associated with dates and time; however, dealing with dates accurately can appear to be a complicated task due to the variety in formats and accounting for time-zone differences and leap years.  R has a range of functions that allow you to work with dates and times.  Furthermore, packages such as [`lubridate`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) make it easier to work with dates and times.

In this section I will introduce you to the basics of dealing with dates.  This includes printing the [current date and time](http://uc-r.github.io/current_date_time/) stamp, [converting strings to dates](http://uc-r.github.io/convert_date/), [extracting and manipulating parts of dates](date_extract), [creating date sequences](date_seq), performing [calculations with dates](date_calc), and dealing with [time zone and daylight savings differences](date_time_zone).  I end with offering [additional resources](date_addtl) to learn and deal with date and time data.
